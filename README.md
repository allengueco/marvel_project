_Exploring data science with the Marvel Universe_

Using the Marvel Universe and data from WikiPedia, I explore areas of data science such as mining, algorithm, machine learning, networks, and natural language processing. I chose to use Jupyter Notebook with a Python 3 kernel for fast executions and visualizations of data. I aim to hopefully make this repository simple as possible to guide those others who also want to explore data science, just as I was when I started this project. I will include relevant comments to walk my program, trying closely follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). 

Relevant libraries of this project include matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, pandas, networkx, and requests.

This project is based on a series of exercises during one of my classes, Computational Analysis of Big Data while studying abroad in Copenhagen.

The character is usually depicted as an ally of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and is a [[Sapience|sapient]] automaton or android. Albert first appeared in \'\'Wolverine\'\' vol. 2 #37 suspended in a tank of liquid and officially appeared in \'\'Wolverine\'\' vol. 2 #38 where he was created by [[Larry Hama]] and [[Marc Silvestri]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAlbert is a robot double of Wolverine who was created along with his counterpart [[Elsie-Dee]] by [[Donald Pierce]]. These androids were designed to kill Wolverine. The Wolverine double was to act as the bait and Elsie-Dee (who outwardly appears to be a 5-year-old girl) was to trap Wolverine in a burning building, where she would detonate with sufficient force to kill him. Initially, Albert had a primitive artificial brain with limited higher logic functions and no emotions, and he was not referred to as Albert, but as "Dummy".<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' Vol. 2 #37 (March 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nPierce\'s plan to kill Wolverine failed because one of the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], Bonebreaker, accidentally gave Elsie-Dee the maximum artificial intelligence one of Pierce\'s automatons was capable of. As a result, Elsie-Dee eventually found a way to defuse her detonation sequence and enhanced the primitive intelligence of her counterpart, giving him intelligence beyond even hers. It was at this point that Elsie named him Albert, after [[Albert Einstein]]. Having met Wolverine, he and Elsie-Dee decided that he was a noble person and did not deserve to die and consequently abandoned their mission.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' Vol. 2 #38 (April 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAs Albert still wasn\'t strong enough to defeat Wolverine, he and Elsie-Dee continued to carry out their mission. While Elsie-Dee saved Wolverine while they were in a burning building, Albert went to an electronic store and hacked into [[NASA]]\'s supercomputers to find a way to crack Donald Pierce\'s programming. After crunching the numbers and sending them to Elsie-Dee, Albert is shot by the police for raiding the electronic store.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' Vol. 2 #39 (May 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAlbert rebuilt himself in the police evidence locker and stole a steal bomber. Then he reconnected with Elsie-Dee.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' Vol. 2 #40 (June 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe two robots risked their artificial lives several times for each other and for Wolverine. At some point they traveled in time and had several adventures, even teaming up with Wolverine\'s old enemy [[Bloodscream]]. Albert gains a leadership role with a local Indian tribe.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' Vol. 2 #86 (October 1994). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, Albert was mentioned in [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]\'s discussion with [[Nur (comics)|Nur]] as one of the Wolverine\'s that they are not looking for.<ref>\'\'Hunt for Wolverine: Weapon Lost\'\' #1 (May 2018). Marvel Comics.</ref> In [[Saskatchewan]], someone that looks like Wolverine massacres the forest rangers and injured people at Ranger Outpost Nine at Meadowlake Provincial Park. When Daredevil, [[Misty Knight]], Nur, and [[Cypher (Marvel Comics)|Cypher]] arrive to investigate the sighting, Cypher is attacked the Wolverine-like character.<ref>\'\'Hunt for Wolverine: Weapon Lost\'\' #2 (June 2018). Marvel Comics.</ref> When Daredevil confronts the character on top of the Attilan Security Force Skycharger, he discovers that it is Albert as Daredevil recalls his history. During the fight with Albert, Daredevil is asked what he did with Elsie-Dee. It took the weapons of Misty Knight, Nur, and a recovered Cypher to deactivate Albert. The four of them left an anonymous tip for the Canadian authorities on where to find him.<ref>\'\'Hunt for Wolverine: Weapon Lost\'\' #3 (July 2018). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAlbert was superhumanly strong, could interface directly with computers, and had an intellect greater than his designer Donald Pierce. Albert had 3 retractable claws on each hand, just as Wolverine (but not adamantium). Albert not only had technological knowledge centuries beyond conventional science (which he was capable of making significant progress in), but also perfect photographic recall and profuse knowledge of even the most obscure facets of history. Albert reinforced his construction with bulletproof armor and stole a stealth fighter, which he and Elsie-Dee may still be in possession of.  Although Albert was initially designed to fight Wolverine he had limited fighting skills.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn \'\'[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]\'\' #85 the [[Timebroker]] gathered multiple teams &ndash; each full of Wolverines &ndash; to finish the repairing of the broken realities. The last team he gathered consisted a version of Albert and Elsie-Dee from Earth-50211. The first mission of the team was to kill an evil [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] (female) who melded with that world\'s Wolverine, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] (female), Scarlet Warlock (male [[Scarlet Witch]]), and [[Mesmero]] (female), and already captured (and manipulated) dozens of Wolverines from the previous teams. When they\'ve arrived they were ambushed immediately and both of them were captured, as well as two of their teammates.<ref>\'\'Exiles\'\' #85 (October 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Video games===\nAlbert appears in \'\'[[Wolverine: Adamantium Rage]]\'\'.\n\n===Toys===\nThe X-Men action figure line originally introduced the character "Albert" in their \'90s series. The official name was Robot Wolverine (Albert) and was the 6th edition of a Wolverine action figure since the series launched. Albert featured human-tissue-covered arms which could be exchanged with a pair of metallic arms with extended claws. The character design reflected a punk warrior look from a bleak future popular in movies like Mad Max.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/albert-elsie-dee UncannyXmen.net Character Profile on Albert & Elsie-Dee]\n\n{{Wolverine}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Robot supervillains]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Larry Hama]]'

A psychopathic assassin, Bullseye uses the opportunities afforded by his line of work to exercise his homicidal tendencies and to work out his own personal vendetta against [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].\n\nAlthough he possesses no [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]], Bullseye is able to use almost any object as a lethal projectile, be it weapons like [[shuriken]] and [[Sai (weapon)|sai]] or seemingly harmless objects like playing cards and pencils. His [[marksmanship]] is uncanny, at a nearly supernatural level, but he has been known to miss moving targets.\n\nThe character has been adapted into various forms of media relating to Daredevil. He was portrayed by [[Colin Farrell]] in the [[Daredevil (film)|2003 film adaptation]] and [[Wilson Bethel]] in the [[Daredevil (TV series)|Netflix television adaptation]].\n\nBullseye was 20th in [[IGN]]\'s list of the "Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/20.html |title=Bullseye is Number 20 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203091526/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/20.html |archivedate=2011-02-03 |df= }}</ref> and 35th in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers".<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/35 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nThe very first appearance of Bullseye was as Bulls-Eye in \'\'[[Nick Fury]] Agent Of SHIELD\'\' # 15, 1969, created by writer [[Gary Friedrich]] and artist [[Herb Trimpe]]. He is an ultra-skilled professional firearms assassin, and his costume sets the template - a concentric target sigil - that is followed/built-upon in later incarnations. In this story, Hydra hires him to assassinate Nick Fury, but he himself is shot down by [[Dum Dum Dugan]] after seemingly having accomplished his mission.\n\nThe character\'s next appearance is in \'\'[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]\'\' <!-- only denote volume number after first --> #131 (March 1976). Although inexplicably resurrected by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[John Romita Sr.]], the book features art by [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]]<ref>Wolfman, in an undated [http://www.ugo.com/channels/freestyle/features/teentitans/ "Comics Channel" interview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718204253/http://www.ugo.com/channels/freestyle/features/teentitans/ |date=July 18, 2006 }} in \'\'Underground Online\'\', recalled: "Bob Brown is the artist that drew the book, but he didn\'t co-create him. I had come up with the character, designed a rough version of the costume and then sat down with John Romita Sr. to do the final version.</ref> and [[Klaus Janson]].\n<!-- Lester or is his name Leonard? The Superherobox says Lester, but the bio says Leonard. -->\n<!-- We don\'t know.  Lester is likely wrong, as at the end of Bullseye: Greatest Hits, he confesses that it\'s actually his brother\'s name. -->\n<!--I amended the info box to reflect this last comment.  The article explains it pretty well. -->\n<!--But his father calls him Lester in Dark Reign Hawkeye#4 -->\n\nBullseye\'s real name and origins are unknown.  He has used the name "Benjamin Poindexter" on several occasions, but there are also instances where his name is given as \xe2\x80\x9cLester". The miniseries \'\'Bullseye: Greatest Hits\'\' (2004) developed the character\'s [[backstory]], but also revealed that some or all of it has been fabricated, probably by Bullseye himself. In this series, Bullseye\'s name was Leonard.\n\nFollowing [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], [[Warren Ellis]] took over writing \'\'[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]\'\' and Bullseye became one of the core members of the new team line-up.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=92433 Better Know a Thunderbolt: Bullseye] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126163051/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=92433 |date=2007-01-26 }}, [[Newsarama]], November 28, 2006</ref>\n\nIn the \'\'[[Secret Invasion]]\'\' aftermath storyline \'\'[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\'\', Bullseye becomes a member of the [[Dark Avengers]] under the alias [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19654 THE OSBORN SUPREMACY: Dark Avengers], [[Comic Book Resources]], January 22, 2008</ref> and features in a five-issue limited series \'\'Dark Reign: Hawkeye\'\', written by [[Andy Diggle]], with art by [[Tom Raney]].<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/030902-HAwkeye-Diggle.html What\'s in a Name? Andy Diggle on Dark Reign: Hawkeye], [[Newsarama]], March 2, 2009</ref> As a member of the Dark Avengers, he has a major role in the crossover \'\'[[Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men]]: Utopia\'\', written by [[Matt Fraction]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21217 IRON PATRIOTISM: Bullseye], [[Comic Book Resources]], May 15, 2009</ref> He appeared as a regular character in the \'\'Dark Avengers\'\' series from issue #1 (March 2009) through issue #16 (June 2010).\n\nBullseye is killed by Daredevil in \'\'[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]\'\' #1, but is later confirmed alive in issue #26 of the third Daredevil comic book series.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Early life and back-story===\nBullseye grew up in [[The Bronx]], where he lived with his brother and his abusive father. His brother\'s main form of recreation was playing with [[rifle]]s, leading Bullseye to become an expert shot. When he was 10 years old, his brother started a fire in their home in an unsuccessful attempt to kill their father. Shortly thereafter, Bullseye was placed in a foster home, and became a [[baseball]] player in [[high school]]. Bullseye was an extremely talented pitcher, and was offered a [[scholarship]], but instead opted to enter the minor leagues. After three games, he was called up to play a sold-out Major League game. He had surrendered no hits the entire game, and in the bottom of the ninth with two outs, he became bored and requested the coach pull him from the game. The coach refused, and insisted that he finish the game. The opposing team\'s batter mocked him, accusing him of cowardice. Bullseye threw the ball at his head, killing him. As the ball struck, he said only one word: "Bullseye". He was barred from professional baseball and convicted of [[manslaughter]].\n\nThis is a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] of a previous origin story from \'\'[[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]\'\' #2, which depicts Bullseye growing up as a below average student in a trailer park with an alcoholic, physically abusive [[Kingmaker (comics)|father]]. In this version of events, Bullseye fakes his father\'s suicide using a handgun set off by a toy arrow. None or all elements of this version may be true since it describes his father as possibly recovering from a recent divorce, fitting in perfectly with Daredevil\'s taunts in their confrontation during the "Hardcore" storyline.\n\nHis cold demeanor and unique skills, however, meant subsequent recruitment by the [[National Security Agency]] as an assassin was inevitable, and he was soon assigned to train [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]]. By the time he arrived, however, he claimed to have already been planning to leave the NSA. He had planned on robbing the Contras blind and fleeing, but soon discovered they were desperately poor. Bullseye made the best of the situation: within seven hours of being informed of their poverty, he had led the Contras in seizing a landing strip that the [[Colombia]]n [[cocaine]] smugglers were using as a staging area before moving on to the [[United States]]. Without use of the airfield, the smugglers were unable to send new shipments. Bullseye set up Paolo, his hapless Nicaraguan translator, as the leader of the new force controlling the airfield, and let the word spread around. However, Paolo was nothing but a [[wikt:patsy|patsy]]. Bullseye planned to invite several [[organized crime]] heads to the airfield to broker a new deal with him as Paolo\'s supposed "right hand man". He would take their money and disappear, presumably leaving Paolo to suffer the wrath of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]], [[Russian Mafia]], [[Yakuza]], and various other criminal elements. However, before the deal could be finalized, the [[Punisher]] (Frank Castle) arrived.\n\nCastle killed all the organized crime leaders in a fiery explosion from which Bullseye barely escaped. The two engaged in a fierce battle in which Bullseye was able to wound Punisher and evade or disable several of his weapons. Bullseye then used some blood-reddened mud to paint a bull\'s-eye on his forehead, mocking Castle\'s inability to hit him. The fight concluded when [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] agents arrived, and the Punisher fled. Bullseye turned himself in to the D.E.A. agents and soon was assigned to infiltrate the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]\'s criminal empire. He obtained a costume, fled yet again, and became one of the most dangerous [[Hitman|hitmen]] in the world.\n\nAll of the above information is given by Bullseye during a subsequent interrogation by US intelligence. Just prior to escaping from custody, Bullseye confesses he made up some or all of his story to amuse himself; for example, he claims that he was really the one who started the fire which burned down his childhood home. The whole capture was a plan by the assassin to gain access to the prison where his father is being held. Bullseye finally gets revenge on his father, leaving him to burn as the prison\'s security systems torch everything inside.\n\n===Costumed criminal career===\nBullseye battles (and defeats) [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] at a circus in order to establish his reputation as an [[extortionist]].<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #131-132</ref> Shortly after, Daredevil by chance overhears him in the midst of an extortion attempt and captures him.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #132</ref> Bullseye is later hired by Maxwell Glenn to kill Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson, and Daredevil interferes. Although Bullseye defeats him again, Daredevil escapes with his life,<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #141-142</ref> and Bullseye\'s professional reputation is damaged as a result. Seeking to regain his credibility, he challenges Daredevil on live television, but is soundly defeated.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #146</ref>\n\nSmarting from this even harsher blow to his reputation, Bullseye hires Eric Slaughter\'s gang and kidnaps the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] (Natasha Romanoff) to bait Daredevil into a revenge bout.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #159-160</ref> Daredevil defeats him again, and the despair of this repeated humiliation drives him to a mental breakdown.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #161</ref> It is later revealed that this breakdown was in part caused by a [[brain tumor]], which begins causing [[migraine]]s, [[paranoia]], and [[hallucination]]s that everyone he meets is Daredevil.<ref name="DD169">\'\'Daredevil\'\' #169</ref> He escapes from prison, but is recaptured by Daredevil, and the tumor is successfully removed.<ref name="DD169"/> The symptoms of the tumor quickly disappear, and defense lawyers are able to have him freed on the argument that his criminal behavior was caused solely by the brain tumor. He is hired to assassinate Kingpin, but meets with repeated failure.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #170-172</ref> Inexplicably, this convinces the Kingpin to employ him as his chief assassin, but he fires him the same day when he witnesses his humiliating defeat at Daredevil\'s hands.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #172</ref> Bullseye\'s repeated failed attempts to regain this briefly-held position became a [[running joke]] of the \'\'Daredevil\'\' series.\n\nWhile in prison, he learns that Kingpin has employed a new chief assassin: [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], Daredevil\'s former lover. After escaping prison, Bullseye attacks Elektra and impales her on her own [[Sai (weapon)|sai]]. This fails to convince Kingpin, who says he will only rehire him if he kills Daredevil.<ref name="Daredevil #181">\'\'Daredevil\'\' #181</ref> Bullseye attempts to ambush Daredevil, but their battle ends with his arch-foe dropping him from atop a telephone wire. The multi-story fall breaks Bullseye\'s back, [[paralysis|paralyzing]] him.<ref name="Daredevil #181"/>\n\nDuring Bullseye\'s extended hospital stay following the fall, Daredevil breaks into his hospital room and forces him to participate in a two-man variation on [[Russian roulette]]. The revolver used in the game is secretly unloaded, but Daredevil has Bullseye take the even-numbered turns so that he would feel sure that the last shot is going to kill him.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #191</ref> Bullseye has repeatedly cited this incident as his greatest grudge against Daredevil.<ref name="DD200">\'\'Daredevil\'\' #200</ref><ref name="Thunderbolts #110">\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #110</ref>\n\nJapanese scientist [[Lord Dark Wind]] liberates Bullseye and has him brought to Japan, where he laces his bones with [[adamantium]], thus restoring his mobility. Lord Dark Wind did this so that Bullseye would work as an assassin for him in return, but in spite the favor done for him, Bullseye refuses to work for free.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #196-199</ref> He instead makes another play to regain the position of chief assassin for the Kingpin, who again says he will give him the position if he kills Daredevil, knowing he would fail.<ref name="DD200"/> Bullseye is imprisoned for several years.\n\nBullseye eventually escapes prison,<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #372</ref> and then battles [[Captain America]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #373-374</ref> He battles [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] in an attempt to assassinate the [[Red Skull]] to regain his old position with the Kingpin.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #377</ref>\n\nBullseye then encounters an amnesiac Daredevil.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #284</ref> He takes advantage of Daredevil\'s amnesia by impersonating him and committing robberies in an attempt to destroy his image.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #285-289</ref> In one of his early heists he is caught by his mark\'s disillusioned [[trophy wife]]. He becomes enamored of her, and when she pleads with him to take her away with him, he keeps her in his derelict hideout as his lover, attempting to flatter her by showering her with stolen money and jewelry. However, she comes to realize that he is mentally weak and, frightened by one of his psychotic outbursts, she leaves him.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #285-287</ref> Gradually Bullseye becomes so immersed in his Daredevil impersonation that he believes himself to truly be Daredevil, a confusion which the real hero takes advantage of in order to defeat him.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #290</ref>\n\nBullseye later has another run-in with the Punisher when he is part of Frank\'s frame-up scheme that ends with Bullseye getting both of his hands shot and losing a finger to the Punisher\'s brutality. Bullseye encounters [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]<ref>\'\'Deadpool\'\' (3rd Series) #16</ref> and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' (3rd Series) #17</ref> during another long interval in which the character was seldom used.\n\nBullseye is hired by the villain [[Mysterio]] to attack and confuse Daredevil.  In the course of their battle, Bullseye kills Daredevil\'s longtime love interest, [[Karen Page]], with one of Daredevil\'s own billy clubs.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' Vol.2 #5</ref>\n\nBullseye is recruited to steal the \'\'[[Identity Disc]]\'\', purported to be in possession of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] and have vital information on the world\'s superheroes, along with Deadpool, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref>\'\'Identity Disc\'\' # 1-5, Aug-Dec 2004</ref>\n\nBullseye offers to kill Daredevil for Kingpin, later entering Daredevil\'s apartment and attempting to kill his old enemy\'s new girlfriend [[Milla Donovan]]. Enraged and already near the breaking point, Daredevil attacks Bullseye and throws him out the window. During the fight, the hero reveals to Bullseye that he knows that his real name is Lester, his mother was a [[prostitution|prostitute]], and that he never knew his father.<ref>\'\'[[Daredevil/Bullseye: The Target]]\'\' #1</ref> He mocks the assassin\'s new \'Bullseye\' tattoo and carves a new one over it with a rock.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' Vol. 2 #49</ref>\n\nBullseye seeks purported documents confirming Daredevil\'s [[secret identity]]. After a brutal fight with Daredevil and Elektra, Bullseye flees into open traffic where he is hit by a truck, sustaining severe injuries.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' vol. 2, #76-81 2005-2006</ref>\n\n===Thunderbolts===\n{{Main|Thunderbolts (comics)|Secret Invasion}}\nBullseye, along with many other villains, is recruited into the New Thunderbolts by [[Iron Man]] and [[Mister Fantastic]] to hunt down anti-registration superheroes in the [[Civil War (comics)|Marvel Civil War]] storyline.<ref>\'\'Civil War\'\' #4</ref> Afterwards he is recruited by [[Norman Osborn]] into the reformed team led by [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]]. He operates invisibly and is not seen by the public. He is used as a last resort and has a nano-chain fed into his system, so if he disobeys orders, he will receive an electrical shock.<ref name="Thunderbolts #110"/>\n\nBullseye fights [[American Eagle (Marvel Comics)|American Eagle]] after having been deceived by [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] and told that she has disabled his nano-chain. During the fight, he simultaneously receives an electrical shock from the nano-chain in his system on order of Moonstone and is attacked by American Eagle. American Eagle beats him severely, mocking him throughout for purposely avoiding fights with superpowered foes, and finally breaks Bullseye\'s neck. As a result of the damage sustained from both being attacked by a man with superhuman strength and being shocked by the nano-chain, Bullseye is paralyzed, is unable to speak, and has incurred severe brain injury.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #115</ref> Bullseye is later shown walking due to nanomechanical surgery, then goes on a killing spree using scalpels to "get some target practice in".<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #121</ref> Later, he joins the Thunderbolts in their efforts to assassinate [[Moon Knight]].<ref>\'\'Moon Knight (vol. 4)\'\' #25</ref>\n\nBullseye was with the Thunderbolts when they fought the [[Skrull]]s in Washington DC.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #123</ref> He took advantage of a recently resurrected [[Fenris (comics)|Andrea von Strucker]] being distracted by [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] to kill Andrea, and nearly kill Moonstone.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #124</ref>\n\nBullseye travels along with the other Thunderbolts to Central Park and joins the final battle against the main Skrull force. Obtaining a missile launcher from the Zeus, he fires a rocket through the right eye of the [[Criti Noll|Yellowjacket Skrull]], disabling him from engaging other heroes.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts #125\'\'</ref>\n\nOsborn orders Bullseye to kill Songbird, finally giving Bullseye the chance for revenge.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #126</ref> Bullseye nearly succeeds, but is incapacitated by the [[Fenris (comics)|Swordsman]] who helps her escape.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #127</ref>\n\n===Dark Avengers===\n{{Main|Dark Reign (comics)}}\nAs a reward from Norman Osborn for his role during the Skrull invasion, Bullseye is placed on the [[Dark Avengers]] and given the costume and codename of \'\'\'[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]\'\'\'.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #1</ref>\n\nNorman Osborn hires Bullseye to eliminate Deadpool, from whom Norman stole data about "how to kill a Skrull queen" but Bullseye is unsuccessful.<ref>\'\'Deadpool\'\'  #3</ref>\n\nOn the Dark Avengers\' first mission, he kills [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgana le Fey]] (who had just died by the hands of Sentry and returned) only for her to return yet again with an army of demons.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #3</ref>\n\nThe Dark Avengers fight a rogue [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] robot, and "Hawkeye" disables the robot after killing its pilot. The robot falls, killing thirty-six civilians. When Osborn reprimands Bullseye for his part in the deaths, Bullseye demands credit for his kills. "Hawkeye" then goes out and saves a woman from being attacked by three men. He kills them, and the woman inadvertently infuriates him by referring to Osborn as "his boss". After he kills her, he notices a news crew in a helicopter filming the action.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: Hawkeye\'\' #1</ref> He silences the news crew by blowing the helicopter up.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: Hawkeye\'\' #2</ref>\n\nBullseye is used to take out his old partner Deadpool. Deadpool eventually gains the upper hand and stabs him through the chest with a meathook. He later wakes up in a hospital and goes after Deadpool again. Deadpool easily avoids Bullseye\'s attacks, then runs Bullseye down, stopping with one of the vehicle\'s tires on Bullseye\'s leg. Bullseye pays off Deadpool (under the pretense that Osborn told him to do so) to save himself.<ref>\'\'Deadpool\'\' #12</ref>\n\nElektra stabs Bullseye with his own arrow.<ref name="dre4">\'\'Dark Reign: Elektra\'\' #4 (June 2009)</ref>\n\nBullseye is later given the order by Osborn to eliminate Daredevil, who has been discovered leading the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: The List - Daredevil\'\'</ref> Daredevil, who is going through the trials needed to join the Hand, and Bullseye clash. Bullseye booby-traps a building with one hundred people in it. Daredevil continues to battle Bullseye unaware that the building is rigged and that Bullseye has the detonator. When the building explodes, Bullseye escapes and leaves Daredevil to his grief, mocking that if Daredevil had chosen to kill him the people in the building might have been saved.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: The List-Bullseye\'\' #1, 2010</ref>\n\n[[Molecule Man]] turns Bullseye into a pool of water to subdue him; however as a liquid he still tries to attack Molecule Man.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #10</ref> He is restored by the Sentry.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #11</ref>\n\nHe is also part of the team when they go to Manhattan to look for Noh-Varr. Sentry finds him first but is distracted and leaves the battle later to find Noh-Varr gone.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers Annual\'\' #1</ref>\n\nOsborn later assigns Bullseye with the duty to kill Sentry\'s wife Lindy.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #14</ref> He takes her for a helicopter ride, and strangles her and dumps her body in the ocean. When the Sentry questions him about Lindy\'s whereabouts, Bullseye claims she committed suicide over the countryside by jumping out of the copter, and the Sentry flies off to find her.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #15</ref>\n\n===Shadowland===\nIn the aftermath of [[Siege (comics)|Siege]], Bullseye is incarcerated and sent to the Raft. However, in the process of being transferred there, he manages to kill his captors and escapes. He makes his way back to Hell\'s Kitchen and arrives at Shadowland, Daredevil\'s fortress, and is confronted by Daredevil and a legion of Hand ninjas. Bullseye is unprepared for his enemy\'s newfound ruthlessness as Daredevil dislocates both his shoulders and then stabs him through the heart with his own sai, in much the same way Bullseye had killed Elektra years before.<ref>\'\'Shadowland\'\' #1</ref>  Later, a group of Hells Bikers put together a funeral service (unauthorized, as [[J. Jonah Jameson]] had expressly forbade it) for Bullseye. [[Ben Urich]] is dragged along, as well as Danny Deaver.  Deaver, however continually sees visions of Bullseye, and it is not clear whether or not it is Bullseye\'s spirit or simply part of Deaver\'s psychosis.  The funeral service is interrupted by Daredevil and the Hand and a massive brawl breaks out, almost killing Urich.<ref>\'\'Shadowland: Bullseye #1\'\'</ref> Daredevil later exhumes Bullseye\'s corpse, intending to resurrect him as a soldier loyal to the Hand.<ref>\'\'Shadowland #3\'\'</ref> The heroes interrupt the ceremony, preventing Bullseye\'s resurrection.<ref>\'\'Shadowland\'\' #4</ref>\n\n===Return===\nIt was later revealed that Bullseye was still barely alive as his body disappeared after the battle, but due to his injuries he has become an invalid who has to rely on a metal lung in order to survive. To get revenge he is revealed to be the mastermind behind Klaw, Coyote, and Ikari\'s actions against Daredevil.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' (vol. 3) #26</ref> He is later found by the hero, who defeated Ikari and Lady Bullseye. The warehouse where they were is subsequently destroyed, and Bullseye is nearly drowned in radioactive waste, leaving him scarred and blind.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' (vol. 3) #27</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\'\' storyline, Bullseye is among the villains attending Kingpin\'s viewing party of the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.<ref>\'\'Secret Wars\'\' #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBullseye has an innate ability to throw virtually any object as a projectile with incredible accuracy and with enough force to be lethal. Some of his accomplishments include lacerating a person\xe2\x80\x99s throat with a thrown playing card, spitting his own tooth through a human skull, tossing a paper airplane to a distant rooftop, and killing a person with a toothpick thrown through a window from a hundred yards away.<ref>\'\'Daredevil: The Target\'\' #1</ref>\n\nAside from his ability to throw projectiles with lethal accuracy, Bullseye is also an expert martial artist and is extremely talented in the use of edged/throwing weapons and conventional firearms.\n\nBullseye has exceptional physical conditioning, with the agility, reflexes, stamina, and speed of a professional athlete.\n\nDue to injuries from a multi-story fall, many of Bullseye\'s bones have been reinforced with strips of adamantium.<ref name="DD197">\'\'Daredevil\'\' Vol. 1 #197</ref> This has increased his resistance to injury in unarmed combat. This reinforcement also allows Bullseye to utilize acrobatic maneuvers impossible for an ordinary human, as his bones are protected from fracture. While [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]\'s adamantium was implanted using only stolen, incomplete notes on the bonding process as a guideline,<ref>\'\'Alpha Flight\'\' #34</ref> and thus only his [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] healing factor allowed him to survive the process, Bullseye\'s surgery was performed properly by [[Lord Dark Wind]] himself, and thus included the special herb treatment which prevents the body from being destroyed by the implantation.<ref name="DD197"/>\n\nBullseye has a compulsive need to study his targets\' histories, abilities, and relationships before engaging them. He employs this information to attempt to anticipate his opponents\' movements in combat. This compulsion often crosses from the professional into the personal, such as Bullseye\'s obsession with Elektra.\n\nDue to a mutual head injury, Bullseye was able to sense Daredevil\'s presence psychically for a brief time.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' Vol. 1 #197-199</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of Apocalypse===\n{{Main|Age of Apocalypse}}\nIn the 1994 arc of a different timeline, Bullseye is seen as one of the humans\' greatest soldiers. Using a machine gun and hitting every enemy target, he fights on the side of "good". He does not wear his original costume, and does not act insane.<ref>\'\'X-Universe\'\' #2</ref>\n\n===Mutant X===\nA version of Bullseye appears in the \'\'[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]\'\' continuity, also a notorious supervillain. Bullseye shows up at the courthouse to assassinate [[Alternative versions of Beast#Mutant X|The Brute]] when The Brute is on trial for murder charges. He is beaten by [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]].<ref>\'\'Mutant X\'\' #6</ref>\n\n===PunisherMAX===\n{{Main|PunisherMAX}}\nA version of Bullseye appears in [[Jason Aaron]]\'s run on \'\'PunisherMax\'\' starting with issue #6. This version of Bullseye is hired by [[Kingpin (comics)#The Punisher: Frank Castle|Kingpin]] to kill The Punisher. He does not wear a costume but has a bullseye tattooed on his forehead. Although his abilities are more realistic than in the mainstream Marvel continuity, he is still a very talented marksman and a deadly fighter, proficient with a variety of weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22088 |title=Jason Aaron Takes Punisher to the MAX |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> His real name is \'\'\'Shelton Pendergrass\'\'\'.<ref>PunisherMax #7</ref>\n\nThis version of Bullseye is [[psychopathic]]/[[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] and extreme [[Obsessive\xe2\x80\x93compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsive]] toward his targets. He is said to have gassed an entire elementary school when some children were witness to a mob hit and then killed the rest of the town with bombs at the mass funeral. Obsessing with getting inside the Punisher\'s head, Bullseye kills the father of a suburban family and takes the wife and children hostage, putting himself in the role of their new husband and father. He then arranges for gunmen to kill the family in front of him to recreate The Punisher\'s origin.

This version has an Irish background, and his traditional costume was dropped in favor of a [[motorcycle|biker]]/[[Heavy metal subculture|metalhead]] style appearance: a reptile-skin [[duster (clothing)|duster]] ([[trench coat]]), leather pants, black tank top, dark goatee, tattoos, multiple earrings, and a shaved head with a bull\'s-eye branding on his forehead, although he does jokingly request a costume from Kingpin. Prior to the film\'s release, the comic book version adopted a near-identical appearance but has since reverted to the traditional look, retaining only the scar. Director [[Mark Steven Johnson]] credited [[Joe Quesada]] for talking him out of using the traditional costume.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rob Worley |date=August 7, 2002 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=14178 |title=\'\'Daredevil\'\' |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> In the movie, Bullseye uses [[shuriken]]s carried in his belt buckle as his main weapon, although he uses many small objects, including peanuts, paperclips, playing cards, shards of broken glass, and a pencil with as much ease. He is hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to kill Nikolas Natchios. Bullseye kills him with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]\'s billy club, causing [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] to believe Daredevil is her father\'s killer. Bullseye begins to perceive Daredevil as a personal challenge, because he is the only target he has ever missed. Later, Elektra attacks Daredevil, seeking revenge, but soon realizes Bullseye killed her father. Elektra and Bullseye battle, and he brutally kills Elektra. Daredevil chases Bullseye to a church, and they battle until Daredevil maneuvers Bullseye\'s hands to be shot by an ESU sniper, leaving him with wounds resembling [[stigmata]]. Daredevil grabs him and throws him out of a window, crashing onto the hood of [[Ben Urich]]\'s car. A final scene shows him hospitalized but still able to flick a hypodermic needle with enough force and accuracy to impale a fly without killing it. Colin Farrell was attached to the role in December 2001.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Swanson |date=December 5, 2001 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117856845.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Farrell targets \'\'Daredevil\'\' |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> Farrell, adopting an American accent for most of his previous films, was encouraged to keep his Irish accent.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ryan J.

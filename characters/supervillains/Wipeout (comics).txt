His first appearance was in \'\'Uncanny X-Men #236\'\'.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWipeout was an elderly member of the [[Press Gang (comics)|Press Gang]], otherwise known as Magistrates, super-powered enforcers of the law on the island-nation of [[Genosha]]. Being elderly, he usually stays behind in Genosha to neutralize the prisoners brought to him by [[Pipeline (comics)|Pipeline]]. In one of his rare field missions, he managed to disrupt the living, sentient vehicle called [[Ship (comics)|Ship]] that [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] used for their headquarters.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\n\nWhen an amnesiac [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] was brainwashed into serving as a Genoshan magistrate, the insane [[Cameron Hodge]] killed Wipeout to frame Havok, who was slowly remembering his true loyalties to the [[X-Men]].{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nWipeout was capable of creating a permanent energy block in people and objects, and could use this ability to remove [[superhuman]] powers.  He created self-perpetuating energy blockages in a person\'s system that prevented bio-genetic power from traveling from their "x-factor" [[gene]]. This power block lasted indefinitely and required no concentration to maintain -- "wiped" mutants stayed powerless after Wipeout fell [[Sleep|asleep]] and after he was killed.\n\nHis ability was not limited to mutant powers.  He could block mutate abilities and technological systems and block the artificial intelligence of the Celestial spacecraft known as Ship.  \n\nHe could mentally remove these blocks at will.\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Genoshans]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}'

The character serves as the main [[antagonist]] of the Winter Soldier storyline.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAleksander Lukin was born in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] village of Kronas some time in the late 1930s. His village was used as the [[Red Skull]]\'s base of operations during the [[Second World War]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' vol. 5 #1</ref> Soviet troops attempt to retake the town, assisted by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]\' [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] superhero team which include [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky Barnes]]; Aleksander\'s mother was killed during the battle\'s course. The Soviet forces\' leader [[Vasily Karpov]] takes the orphaned Lukin under as a protege.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' vol. 5 #5</ref>\n\nIn the ensuing decades, Lukin became an important figure in the Soviet military and the [[KGB]], rising to the General rank.<ref name="Cap6">\'\'Captain America\'\' vol. 5 #6</ref> After his mentor\'s passing, Lukin is left in custody of a large cache of special projects developed over the decades, including the Winter Soldier.<ref name="Cap6"/> He sells some of these devices to the highest bidders to raise funds. In one instance, he sells weapons to the Red Skull himself, but refuses to part with the Winter Soldier for anything less than the reality-altering [[Cosmic Cube]] (which the Red Skull was not in possession of and would not give up in any case).<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' vol. 5 #9</ref>\n\nFive years after that meeting, the Red Skull finally recovers the Cosmic Cube, only to be assassinated by the Winter Soldier on Lukin\'s orders. However, the Red Skull used the Cosmic Cube to transfer his own mind right before death into Lukin\'s body, leaving the two men stuck together "like rats in a cage".<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' vol. 5 #12-15</ref>\n\nLukin uses the Cosmic Cube to enrich his legitimate business front Kronas Corporation. But when, in a fit of rage, the Cosmic Cube harms one of his friends, Lukin has the Cosmic Cube sent away. After the Winter Soldier destroys the Cosmic Cube and regains his own memories, Lukin and the Red Skull have worked uneasily together against their common foe Captain America, even as the Red Skull wages a campaign for control of Lukin\'s body; Lukin vows to kill himself before allowing that to happen.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' vol. 5 #18</ref>\n\nUpon the Winter Soldier\'s discovery of Lukin\'s connection with the Red Skull, the Red Skull and Lukin fake \'their\' death to continue to operate from the shadows.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' vol. 5 #25</ref> With Bucky as Captain America, the pair contrive to abduct [[Sharon Carter]] to attach to a machine that will bring back the time-displaced Steve Rogers, however, their captive rebels and destroys the machine. In a last-ditch maneuver, [[Arnim Zola]] transfers the Red Skull\'s consciousness into a robot while Lukin is free at last before being gunned down by Carter only a few seconds afterwards.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' vol. 5 #42</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television and film===\n* Aleksander Lukin is mentioned in \'\'[[The Avengers: Earth\'s Mightiest Heroes]]\'\'.

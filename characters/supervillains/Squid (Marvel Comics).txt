After his mother died, Don had a hard time relating to his father "Big Mike" Callahan. He eventually fell into the wrong crowd and ended up transformed into a mouthless squid-like creature. In his first outing as a supervillain, Squid and his girlfriend [[Ms. Fortune]] battled [[Spider-Man]] on a rooftop. Spider-Man defeated them.<ref>Peter Parker: Spider-Man II#16</ref>\n\nAfter their failure, the ones responsible for Squid\'s creation attacked him and Ms. Fortune (who barely survived). She broke up with Squid. Squid was later hired by an unnamed Upper West Side crime boss to eliminate the local businessmen that won\'t sell their properties to him. Squid later dragged a cigar store owner named "Old Man" Frenzetti into the sewers and later killed him. He later confronted his father at a bar and then stormed out as Peter Parker entered. Squid later came up through the sink pipes of Miguel Vargas\' coffee shop in an attempt to kill him. Miguel escaped as Mike Callahan attacked him with a baseball bat. Squid broke the bat, but was blindsided by Spider-Man. Both Spider-Man and Mike managed to calm Squid down with Mike telling his son his apology for the way he treated him. After a long talk in the night, Squid was presumably taken away by the police.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man II #26</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\'\' storyline, Squid was among the villains recruited into [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]\'s unnamed supervillain army to take advantage of the Civil War.

In his squid-like form, he possesses extendable tentacles that restrain a human with Class 10 strength. Squid can also emit foul-smelling ink from his hands. He later had an ability to emit ink constantly from his entire body. Seeing how he can fit through pipes, Squid is presumably boneless in this form.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/scungili.htm#Squid Squid (Scungli)] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/school.htm#Squid%20I Squid (The School)] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/squidcallahan.htm Squid (Don Callahan)] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe\n\n{{Spider-Man}}\n{{Sinister Six}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Dan Slott]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Howard Mackie]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita Jr.]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Scott Lobdell]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Leialoha]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1949]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1982]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1989]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2000]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2014]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]'

His first appearance was in \'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #31.\n\n==Publication history==\nOrphan-Maker\'s first appearance was in \'\'X-Factor\'\' #31 (August 1988), and he was created by [[Louise Simonson]] and [[Walt Simonson]].\n\nThe character subsequently appears in \'\'X-Factor\'\' #35 (December 1988), #40 (May 1989), \'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #247-248 (August-September 1989), #265-267 (August-September 1990), \'\'Generation X\'\' #2-4 (December 1994-February 1995), \'\'Generation X Holiday Special\'\' #1 (February 1998), \'\'Slingers\'\' #9 (August 1999), and \'\'Wolverine: Killing Made Simple\'\' #1 (October 2008).\n\nOrphan-Maker received an entry in the \'\'[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update \'89]]\'\' #5.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nLittle is known of Orphan-Maker\'s past but apparently, Peter was held captive in [[Mister Sinister]]\'s "orphanage" for unknown reasons{{Fact|date=May 2009}}. Mr. Sinister had instead decided that Peter was too uncontrollable and must be killed. Saved by the [[cyborg]] [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]], he became the first of her "Lost Boys (and Girls)". Under Nanny\'s direction, Peter, as the Orphan-Maker, began to kill the parents of young mutants (and thus "orphaning" them)  and abducting them for Nanny.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}\n\nThey would confront the X-Men operating out of a small, faux-town in the Australian outback. [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] and [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] are ambushed and stunned in a ship designed to look like a crash-landed artifact. The captured are physically converted into children. They are given battlesuits themselves and convinced to attack the other X-Men. Some assistance is given by [[Jubilation Lee|Jubilee]], whom the X-Men did not know of at the time. {{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nOrphan-Maker and Nanny are temporarily defeated after [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] rescues Havok from his battlesuit. Confused and disoriented from his experience, Havok blasts Nanny\'s ship, causing much destruction and seemingly causing the death of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]. However, Orphan-Maker and Nanny had left behind a dead body that looked like Storm, while de-aging and kidnapping her.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nThe pair would later confront [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], a super-team made up of the five original X-Men.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nDuring an incident where a mentally ill young mutant had taken hostages inside his school, Orphan-Maker was driven away partly because the mutant [[Skin (Marvel Comics)|Skin]] managed to interfere with his suit\'s energy flow. He managed to escape pursuit in a technologically advanced vehicle disguised as an ice cream truck.<ref>\'\'[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]\'\' #4</ref>\n\nMost recently, he and Nanny battled with Wolverine after they tried to make Trance an orphan. <ref>\'\'[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]\'\' Killing Made Simple</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nOrphan-Maker is a mutant, but has yet to exhibit powers aside from those of his hi-tech battle suit. Also, he remains intellectually a child.\n\n===Battle Suit===\nOrphan-Maker\'s armor is highly resistant to most forms of attack, and has certain reflective properties that allow him to deflect energy attacks such as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]\' optic blasts. The suit also enhances his strength, and may suppress his mutant powers{{Fact|date=May 2009}}. Orphan-Maker is equipped with large guns that fire destructive energies. When he was outfitted with his new armor, the suit had the capability of forming guns out of its hands.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/orphanmakerpeter.htm|Orphan-Maker}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Louise Simonson]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Walt Simonson]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

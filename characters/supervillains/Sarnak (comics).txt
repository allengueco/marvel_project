He got into legal trouble for being involved in an operation to bootleg albums from popular artists.  He attempted to escape persecution, and ended up scarring his face "for life", as he put it.   He covered his scars by wearing a green mask.\n\nWhile healing from his injuries,  he studied sound further and as a result, he created a whistle that would allow him to control \nthe minds of anyone hearing it.    He joined  The Committee and used the whistle to create an army of homeless derelicts, which he named " The Legion of Fear".       At the request of The Committee,  Sarnak attempted to capture [[Jack Russell (comics)|Jack Russell]] and his sister because they were werewolves.  (Sarnak was unaware that the committee had a special interest in werewolves ).\nThe first attempt failed, with Jack fighting two of the legion of fear\'s derelicts to a draw.     At the second attempt, Sarnak knocked out Jack by blowing his whistle.   He brought Jack to his hideout, in the sewers below Los Angeles and made Jack obey him and cause chaos in the city of Los Angeles,  in his werewolf form.    Sarnak captured his sister, but Jack managed to get away and seek assistance from another\nsound engineer to create a device that would prevent Jack from hearing Sarnak\'s whistle.   With the device secured to his arm,\nJack came back the following night and invaded Sarnak\'s headquarters and freed his sister.  Sarnak attempted to use his whistle on Jack (in were wolf form), however, due to the device on Jack\'s arm, the whistle fails to work on him.\nJack is able to defeat Sarnak, Sarnak loses his hold on the Legion of fear, who unmask him and, it\'s hinted, kill him.\n\n== Powers and Abilities ==\n\'\'\'Powers:\'\'\' - None\n\n\'\'\'Abilities:\'\'\' - Superb sound engineer, inventor of his control whistle.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Werewolf_By_Night Werewolf by Night] at Marvel.com\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/russelljackww.htm|Werewolf by Night}}\n* [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/mailittomarvell/wwbn.htm&date=2009-10-26+02:07:38 Werewolf by Night Appearances in Publication Order]\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Sarnak_%28Earth-616%29 Sarnak at Marvel Wikia ]\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

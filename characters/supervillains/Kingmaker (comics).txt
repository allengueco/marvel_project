Though it isn\'t apparent whether or not the Kingmaker has any superhuman powers of his own, his personal fortune and resources have allied him with various figures of the supervillain underworld. In essence, the Kingmaker is a high-stakes loan shark, but one who deals in favours rather than money. His standard agreement involves delivering any one wish to an applicant in exchange for a favour to be named later. His network of favours have given him vast financial reserves, business agreements with powerful individuals, and a personal trove of high-tech weaponry for his personal defence. He may even have some magical strength to draw upon. He has a history with [[Emma Frost]], as a result of her rejection of his bid for membership in the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].\n\nWhen [[New X-Men]] member [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] was denied his family inheritance, he investigated their financial history, eventually discovering their involvement with the Kingmaker. Conducting a peculiar ritual, Hellion and his team-mates were contacted by the Kingmaker, who offered them his standard contract. In exchange for their deepest wishes, the kids were tasked with stealing a device for their benefactor. Unbeknownst to the Hellions, the device was a biological weapon that the Kingmaker was retrieving for none other than [[Doctor Octopus]]. The kids managed to retrieve the device, but after a briefing with [[Nick Fury]], the Hellions turned on the Kingmaker. After several losing battles, the Hellions finally managed to defeat the villain, who was then arrested. He was later released by Emma Frost, who convinced him to leave her students alone under threat of using her mental powers to get him sent back to jail.<ref>\'\'New X-Men: Hellions\'\' #4</ref>\n\n===Bullseye\'s Father===\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Kingmaker \n|real_name=\n|species=[[Human]]\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=\'\'[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]: Hawkeye\'\' #4 (September, 2009)\n|creators=[[Andy Diggle]]<br>[[Tom Raney]]\n|alliances=\n|aliases=\n|powers=\n|}}\nThe second Kingmaker is the father of [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] who appeared during the \'\'[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\'\' storyline. When Bullseye was fighting an army of Hawkeyes and took them out except for one, he was captured by Solo and brought before Kingmaker. Kingmaker prepares to trade his old burned husk of a body for his son\'s by placing his brain in Lester\'s body. Unfortunately, nobody told him that Bullseye\'s bones are laced with adamantium which not only is impossible to cut, but also blocks Kingmaker\'s neural inhibitor.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: Hawkeye\'\' #4</ref>\n\nBullseye fights his way through Solo in order to get to his dad. After Bullseye successfully kills Kingmaker, he frightens [[Ben Urich]] from filing a story on Kingmaker.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: Hawkeye\'\' #5</ref>\n\n===Pryor Cashman===\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Kingmaker\n|real_name=Pryor Cashman\n|species=[[Human]]\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=\'\'[[Norman Osborn|Osborn]]\'\' #1 (January, 2011)\n|creators=[[Kelly Sue DeConnick]]<br>[[Emma Rios]]\n|alliances=\n|aliases=\n|powers=Memory manipulation\n|}}\nThe third Kingmaker is Pryor Cashman who is described as a "demon entity" who psychically "feeds" off the memory of any humans. He is additionally able to see and alter the memories of others, and has used this ability in the past to create dictators. At some point, he was captured by government officials and incarcerated in a secret location several miles underwater.<ref>\'\'Osborn\'\' #1</ref>\n\nWhen [[Norman Osborn]] himself was jailed in the facility after being transferred from the Raft, Kingmaker was among the inmates who staged a break-out following a prison riot alongside Norman Osborn, [[June Covington]], [[List of incarnations of Spider-Man#Ai Apaec|Ai Apaec]], and Carny Rives.<ref>\'\'Osborn\'\' #2</ref>\n\nMaking their way to an escape pod, Norman Osborn and the rest of the inmates were able to go free.

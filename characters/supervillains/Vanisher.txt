He commits a series of spectacular crimes: building a large criminal organization, stealing continental defense plans from the [[United States]] government, and attempting to extort millions of dollars from the U.S. government. With the support from a large group of non-mutant followers, he goes to the front lawn of the [[White House]] to await his payment.

Along with [[Eel (comics)|Eel]] and a woman named Blitz, the Vanisher is part of the Outer Circle of the Enforcers and becomes involved in a clash between the criminal organizations [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] and [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]].

The limits on the Vanisher\'s teleportation range and the maximum amount of mass he can teleport with himself are unknown, but he can teleport himself and several others from southern California to New York without any visible strain. The Vanisher has a subconscious [[extra-sensory perception|extrasensory]] ability that prevents him from materializing part or all of his body within a solid object, even if he has never before been to the area he is teleporting to. This allows the Vanisher to teleport with greater ease than Nightcrawler.

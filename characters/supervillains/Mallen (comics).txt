He serves as the main [[antagonist]] of the \'\'[[Extremis]]\'\' storyline.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe character first appeared in \'\'[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]\'\' vol. 4 #1 (January 2005) and was created by [[Warren Ellis]] and [[Adi Granov]]<ref name="IM1">\'\'Iron Man\'\' vol. 4 #1</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nMallen\'s parents were killed in a shootout with the FBI over weapons violations in [[Texas]]. After being in a tragic farm accident as a child and forever being referred to as "Miracle Baby", he grew up bitter, grew a sense of hatred for government and believed in white superiority aligning himself with a small cell of domestic terrorists. In [[Bastrop, Texas|Bastrop]], they were given the experimental-[[Extremis]] drug (which was created by [[Aldrich Killian]]) by a supplier whose identity wasn\'t known yet. Mallen took it, and had a massive [[spasm]], and was locked down by the other two. 2 days later, emerging from an external scab-like [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]], he emerged as a superhuman threat.<ref name="IM1"/>\n\nUnder Extremis, Mallen attacked the [[Houston]] [[FBI]] branch, with him slaughtering every one in the building, even scaring the terrorists themselves.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' vol. 4 #2</ref> While in a van, he was confronted by [[Iron Man]] who had the others arrested. In a fight, he badly injured Stark in his [[Iron Man\'s armor|armor]] (shattering his right knee, cracking his chest plate, and crushing his right hand) and then set out to kill the U.S. leaders in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' vol. 4 #3</ref> He briefly stopped to talk with a protester, and ended up murdering her over her views. <ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' vol. 4 #4</ref>\n\nMallen was intercepted outside by Iron Man, he himself having taken Extremis. Mallen was defeated but refused to give up, forcing Iron Man to kill him, blowing up his head with his repulsors, even after which his then headless body began to get up, falling down shortly afterwards. Stark discovered that Extremis designer/former girlfriend Dr. [[Maya Hansen]] (who helped Aldrich Killian create Extremis) was the one dealing the drug to the terrorists Mallen was involved in.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' vol. 4 #5</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDue to the mutation that resulted by consuming the Extremis drug, Mallen gained the abilities of superhuman strength, speed (shown to run faster than 200&nbsp;mph), stamina, agility, healing, endurance and durability. He can also exhale a fiery breath, and also has sharp claws and the ability to generate massive electric discharges.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Mallen (and elements of the Extremis plot) appear in the \'\'[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]\'\' second season episode "Extremis". Instead of a terrorist, Mallen used to be an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], but was fired for unstable psychological behavior. Out of spite, he stole their experimental super-soldier serum Extremis, injected himself with it and was transformed into a superhuman, whereupon he started assaulting S.H.I.E.L.D. agents all over [[New York City|the city]]. Iron Man shows up to stop him, but Mallen mercilessly beats him to near-death. Mallen is driven off and subsequently goes on another rampage, whereupon he is confronted by [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Nick Fury]], who are easily beaten. However, Iron Man (after injecting himself with a controlled low dosage of the Extremis serum and gained enhanced physical, mental and cyberpathic abilities) intervenes and electrocutes Mallen into a coma who is then taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.\n\n===Motion comic===\n* In the Iron Man: Extremis [[Motion Comic]], Mallen is voiced by [[Ted Lewis (voice actor)|Ed Paul]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Mallen Mallen] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Mallen_%28Earth-616%29 Mallen] at Marvel Wiki\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/mallenstark.htm|Mallen}}\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/mallen/29-51544/ Mallen] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Iron Man}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Warren Ellis]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2005]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Texas]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with electric or magnetic abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with fire or heat abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional super soldiers]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]'

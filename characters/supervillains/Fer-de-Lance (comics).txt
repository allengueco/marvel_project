Betraying Sidewinder and Diamondback, Fer-de-Lance was the first to find the pair hiding in a control room. During the skirmish, Fer-de-Lance lunged at Diamondback, who promptly dodged her attack. Fer-de-Lance, pressing her retractable razors into a computer, suffered an electric shock and was defeated.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #341-342</ref>  After Viper abandoned the group of mercenaries, Fer-de-Lance continued to serve with the Serpent Society.\n\nDuring one mission with the Serpent Society, Fer-de-Lance and her comrades Copperhead and Diamondback were ambushed by the mysterious [[Mister Jip]].

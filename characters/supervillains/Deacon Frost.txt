He appears in \'\'[[The Tomb of Dracula]]\'\', and is an enemy of [[Blade (comics)|Blade]]. In the comics, Deacon Frost was depicted as a tall, white-haired, late middle-aged gentleman with red eyes, and wearing 1860s Germany period clothing. His doppelg\xc3\xa4nger sported an accent and attire that suggested a [[Southern United States|Southern]] preacher.\n\nThe character appeared in the 1998 film \'\'[[Blade (film)|Blade]]\'\', portrayed by [[Stephen Dorff]].\n\n==Publication history==\nDeacon Frost first appeared in \'\'[[The Tomb of Dracula]]\'\' #13 (October 1973), and was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Gene Colan]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nDeacon Frost was allegedly a scientist looking for the key to immortality. For one of his experiments, he kidnapped a young woman in order to inject his victim with the blood of a recently killed [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]]. The girl\'s fianc\xc3\xa9 broke into the lab, and (in the resulting scuffle) Frost was accidentally injected with the blood himself. The result was that Frost became a vampire but (due to the unusual method of becoming one) he was endowed with a unique characteristic. Anyone he turned into a vampire would generate a [[doppelg\xc3\xa4nger]]. He could create an unlimited number of doppelg\xc3\xa4ngers by biting each doppelg\xc3\xa4nger, and they would all be under his mental control. Frost intended to use this ability to contend for the position of Lord of Vampires, a position that was presently held by [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]]. Frost is the vampire responsible for the death of [[Blade (comics)|Blade]]\'s mother; Blade\'s initial mission is to exact revenge against the woman\'s killer.{{issue|date=July 2018}} It was also Frost who turned [[Hannibal King]] into a vampire.{{issue|date=July 2018}} Blade and King (while initially distrusting each other) eventually teamed up to fight Frost\'s army of doppelgangers of Blade and King.{{issue|date=July 2018}} The two of them managed to defeat and apparently destroy Frost in his underground hideout, stabbing him twice and leaving his body to be consumed as his hideout exploded.{{issue|date=July 2018}}\n\nMany years later, Blade encountered a vampire that called itself Deacon Frost.{{issue|date=July 2018}} This vampire had a different appearance and personality to the original, and was later identified as being a doppelg\xc3\xa4nger.{{issue|date=July 2018}} The doppelg\xc3\xa4nger attempted to summon a powerful demon, only to be devoured by said creature.{{issue|date=July 2018}} In a later one-shot story set in [[New Orleans]], Frost was encountered yet again, but he appeared as he did in \'\'The Tomb of Dracula\'\'. He also confirmed that the previous encounter was indeed an imposter (as Blade suspected) who was created using science and magic. Blade and King, with the help of [[Brother Voodoo]], foiled Frost\'s attempt to gain control of Garwood Industries through Donna Garth (daughter of [[Simon Garth]] the Living [[Zombie (comics)|Zombie]]). Frost escaped this encounter vowing revenge.{{issue|date=July 2018}} More recently, Frost appeared at the summons of Dracula to defend the Lord of Vampires as he underwent a magical ritual, only to be staked by Blade.{{issue|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Other versions==\n=== Earth-9991 ===\nWhile roughhousing, two boys enter the parking garage where Frost is located with his latest creation, a monster called the White Worm.

Frost is known as the four-fanged vampire and famed as powerful even for vampire standards, with his organization greatly spreading its influence in Asia, this puts him in conflict with the council of pure-blood vampires who have ruled Europe for many centuries. While responsible for many tragedies surrounding Blade and others, Frost suffered his own tragic event while human. Having witnessed his son Edgar killed by a vampire and further infuriated by corrupt police that were not looking into the case, Frost decided to research vampires with the help of many vampire hunters he hired to the purpose of turning himself into a stronger breed of vampire. This ultimately motivates Frost\'s goal to wipe out the old vampire race, then rule the world with a race of genetically altered vampires created from Blade\'s own Daywalker blood. Deacon Frost has done experiments on the [[Mandurugo]], the [[Manananggal]], and the [[Sundel bolong]]. By the end of the series, Deacon Frost drinks the blood in his daywalking vampires to assume a stronger form, but is slain moments after in a final showdown with Blade, using his mother\'s and Makoto\'s silver weapons.\n\n===Film===\n[[Image:Sd lamagra.gif|thumb|right|230px|[[Stephen Dorff]] as Deacon Frost / La Magra in the 1998 film \'\'[[Blade (film)|Blade]]\'\'.]]\n* Deacon Frost appeared as the main antagonist of the 1998 film \'\'[[Blade (film)|Blade]]\'\', portrayed by [[Stephen Dorff]]. This depiction was a younger and more updated version for the 1990s while retaining his upstart ambitions. His main objective was to become the vampire God \'\'\'La Magra\'\'\' and rid the world of humans, believing it belongs to the vampire race. After killing the House of Erebus\' leaders as part of the ritual, Blade and Karen Jenson spoiled Frost\'s plans. Despite their efforts however, Frost managed to complete the ritual and be one with La Magra, engaging Blade in a sword battle. During the fight, Blade managed to gain the upper hand, cutting off Frost\'s right arm and then proceeded to cut him in half, only for Frost\'s top half to re-connect and regrow his right arm. But after a stand-off, Frost was finally killed by Blade\'s use of [[Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid|EDTA]] darts which caused him to explode.\n* Deacon Frost was mentioned in \'\'[[Blade II]]\'\' as not being well liked in the vampire community; vampire warlord Eli Damaskinos and "familiar"/lawyer Karl Kounen said that Blade "actually did [them] a favor" with Frost\'s death.\n* Stephen Dorff told Wordpass.com in 2009 that there was a prequel trilogy with his character in development and that [[Stephen Norrington]] would be involved in the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dietrichthrall.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/blade-spinoff-in-development-will-feature-stephen-dorff-reprising-deacon-frost-role/ |title=\xe2\x80\x98BLADE\xe2\x80\x99 Spinoff In Development: Will Feature STEPHEN DORFF Reprising DEACON FROST Role |publisher=Dietrichthrall.wordpress.com |date=2009-07-08 |accessdate=2011-01-08}}</ref> However, in 2012 the rights for Blade returned to [[Marvel Studios]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Borys |last=Kit |title=Fox\'s Daredevil Rights on Verge of Reverting to Marvel as Ticking Clock Looms (Video) |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/daredevil-marvel-fox-comic-adaptation-sequel-361982 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 14, 2012 |accessdate=August 10, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69we1jNvv?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/daredevil-marvel-fox-comic-adaptation-sequel-361982 |archivedate=August 15, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\nDeacon Frost appears as the main antagonist on the Blade table in \'\'[[Marvel Pinball]]\'\'.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/frostdeaconblade.htm|Deacon Frost}}\n\n{{Blade}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frost, Deacon}}\n[[Category:Blade (comics)]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gene Colan]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1973]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics vampires]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]'

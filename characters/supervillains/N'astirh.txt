He also has the ability of flight due to his natural leather wings.\n\nTransformation by the techno-organic transmode virus allows him the ability to alter his own shape and can rebuild his body from a single cell when destroyed or injured, and he can infect others with the transmode virus, converting them into "techno-organic" beings and absorbing their life energy. The virus also granted him a computer like mind allowing him to cast spells and process them almost simultaneously.\n\nN\'astirh has a gifted intellect, and possesses extensive knowledge of black magic gained through study of Belasco\'s principal book of sorcery.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Video games===\n* Android replicas of N\'astirh appear in \'\'[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade\'s Revenge]]\'\' as mini-bosses.\n* N\'astirh appears in \'\'[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]\'\', voiced by [[Steven Blum]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/N%27astirh N\'astirh] at Marvel.com\n* [http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/characters/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=1316 Uncannyxmen.net bio]\n\n{{X-Men}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Louise Simonson]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics demons]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

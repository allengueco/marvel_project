Piecemeal was a [[cyborg]] villain, a foe of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\nPiecemeal was created by scientists in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon jungle]], under the auspices of the [[Red Skull]]. Pieces of animal corpses were combined with a captured spy from the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] and advanced technology to form a formidable killing machine. Before the cyborg's blanked mind could be reprogrammed, the Hulk discovered the lab and destroyed it. However, Piecemeal managed to escape in the confusion. Wandering through the jungle, it chanced upon a small airport, and stowed away on a cargo plane headed for [[Loch Ness]], [[Scotland]].{{issue|date=June 2015}}\n\nA short time later, a retired member of the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] (an organisation to which the Hulk was allied at the time) who owned an inn near the loch sent for the Hulk when it seemed like a new monster had appeared, when in reality, Piecemeal had been attacking people and draining their minds.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 1 #408</ref>{{issue|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe Hulk faced Piecemeal in battle, and was victorious, although Piecemeal's body was never found, suggesting it may still be living in the Loch.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (Vol. 2) #403</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n\nAs a cyborg, Piecemeal possessed mechanically-augmented strength. It had claws that could shred steel, and a tail that could crush a concrete bunker. It could generate bursts of bioelectricity strong enough to shatter a tank.

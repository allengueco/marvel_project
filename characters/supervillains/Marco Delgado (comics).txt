He was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and debuted in \'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #1\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nHarry Delgado was possibly a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. who was hunting the people who became the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] that attempted to join [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] aboard [[Asteroid M]]. Harry was a S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent who rejected the more brutal tactics of his partners, and a mysterious "Delgado" later appeared on the Acolytes themselves, utilizing mutant powers of size-alteration. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Beast (comics)|The Beast]] question whether this is the same individual who later switched sides, a man with a coincidental name, or something else, but no answer ever comes. \n\nOne theory is that they are in fact two men sharing the same name, although the relationship between the two (if any) is never confirmed. The appearance of the second man named Delgado matches that of one of the Acolytes shown in an earlier panel over Major Delgado\'s left shoulder (X-Men #1 Page 20, Panel 5). This man addresses Major Delgado as only "Flatscan" - the Acolyte\'s term for baseline humans - and no other interaction between the two is ever shown. While Major Delgado has a thin mustache and appears to show no beard, the second man has a clear chin-strap beard. When the Acolyte Delgado appears on Genosha later in the same issue, he has a chin-strap beard and a thin mustache, matching that of the Acolyte who was shown in the earlier panel standing over Major Delgado\'s shoulder. \n\nDelgado was often targeted by those Acolytes who were able to manipulate the abilities of their fellow brethren, such as the power-boosting [[Fabian Cortez]] and the molecule-altering [[Chrome (comics)|Chrome]].\n\nDelgado died in the destruction of Asteroid M, which was engineered by the treacherous Cortez who intended to gain points in the so-called Upstart Competition by disposing of Magneto and the [[X-Men]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\n[[Selene (comics)|Selene]] revives him with the [[Techno-organic virus|T/O Virus]] during the [[Necrosha]] event.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}  However, he was killed again during a fight with [[Deadpool]] and [[Loa (comics)|Loa]].<ref>\'\'X-Force Annual\'\' #1</ref>\n\n==Powers==\nDelgado was a mutant with the power to grow in size, strength, speed, and stamina. The upper limits of the size that he could attain and the strength that he could wield were never ascertained. Delgado drew the extra mass that he gained upon using his power from a presumably extradimensional source.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Marco Delgado was one of the thousands of mutants that joined the armies of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], eventually reaching the rank of Prelate. Unlike his [[Earth-616]] counterpart, this version of Delgado had been altered and his skin was covered in rock.\n\nWhen [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] were searching for evidence that Apocalypse was continuing his cullings of humans despite signing the Kelly Pact, their investigation would lead them to Chicago where they are eventually discovered by Delgado. Overpowered by the minion of Apocalypse and with Sunfire injured, Blink was forced to open a portal directly back to the X-Men\'s headquarters in the ruins of the old Xavier estate. Delgado followed them partway through, however before he could cause any serious damage, Blink closed the portal on him, cleaving him in half. \n\nDelgado\'s sacrifice, however,  allowed Apocalypse\'s minion Rex to get a partial location on the X-Men\'s hideout.<ref>\'\'Astonishing X-Men\'\' #1 (March, 1995)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Delgado appeared in the two-part \'\'[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]\'\' episode "Sanctuary." He is shown as a prominent member of the Acolytes.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Marco_Delgado_(Earth-616) Marco Delgado] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Delgado, Marco}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n\n[[fr:Delgado (comics)]]'

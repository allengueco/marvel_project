This version of Firebrand is the son of the late ex-[[Stark Industries]] employee Simon Gilbert, who had stolen money from Stark and started a fire that killed Simon, which Gary blamed Tony Stark for. Firebrand was attacking power sources and demanding a ransom of a million dollars. After a series of arson upon power generators, Iron Man confronted Firebrand and had to use his Inferno Armor to confront him. With the lack of solar energy, Iron Man had a hard time stopping a dam that Firebrand detonated. A fragment of the dam hits Firebrand\'s jet pack causing him to fall into the flood. With Iron Man low on power, [[War Machine]] had to face his fear of water to rescue Iron Man and Firebrand. After diverting the flood, Iron Man and War Machine handed Firebrand over to the police as Firebrand still shouts for justice against Tony Stark.\n* Firebrand appears in the \'\'[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]\'\' episode "World On Fire." This version is a fire spirit and the guardian of the 4th Makluan Ring located in the Temple of Temperance at the foot of [[Mt. Saint Helens]]. When James Rhodes becomes possessed by Firebrand, upon inadvertently throwing ice into a pillar of light, it turns him into a powerful lava monster thus starting the Test of Temperance. When [[Pepper Potts|Pepper]] ends up doing the opposite by throwing coal into the light, Firebrand leaves James\' body and possesses Pepper. James manages to call up [[Mandarin (comics)|Gene]] and learns that the coals and the ice must go in the light together. Once that was done, Firebrand leaves Pepper\'s body.<ref>Iron Man Armored Adventures: World on Fire</ref>\n* The Rick Dennison version of Firebrand appeared in a cameo in the \'\'[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]\'\' episode "Flight of the Iron Spider" being defeated by Spider-Man wearing an "Iron Spider" armor.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marveldatabase.com/Gary_Gilbert_%28Earth-616%29 Firebrand I] at Marvel Wiki\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/firebrandbroxtel.htm|Firebrand II}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/firebranddennison.htm|Firebrand III}}\n\n{{Iron Man}}\n{{New Warriors}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Archie Goodwin]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Don Heck]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Kurt Busiek]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Matt Fraction]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1970]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1998]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2012]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional activists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Detroit]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with fire or heat abilities]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

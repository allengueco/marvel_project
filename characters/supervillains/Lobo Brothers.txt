The brothers are Carlos and Eduardo and are later joined by their sister: Esmeralda Lobo.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Lobo Brothers first appeared in \'\'[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]\'\' #143 (October 1988) and were created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Sal Buscema]].\n\n==Fictional characters biography==\nCarlos and Eduardo Lobo grew up in poverty on the streets of [[Puebla de Zaragoza]], [[Mexico]], surviving by stealing and scavenging for food. As a teenager, Eduardo had fallen in love with a girl name Esmelda Valdez, the daughter of a wealthy ranch owner. The two had a romantic relationship until it was discovered by Esmelda\'s brother Ram\xc3\xb3n Valdez. One full moon night, Ram\xc3\xb3n and his men ambushed the two lovers and tried to drive Eduardo away by using whips on him. Pain and rage from this whipping triggered a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] change in Eduardo\'s body. He turned into a black-furred [[werewolf]] and slaughtered Ram\xc3\xb3n and his men. But when he woke up in his human form the next morning, he discovered he had murdered Esmelda as well. Carlos also discovered he was a mutant that can turn into a brown-furred werewolf. The brothers then turned to crime using their powers to unite all the mobs of South Texas into Los Hermanos De La Luna. The Lobo Brothers were so successful that they not only gained a mansion in a Dallas suburb but drew the attention of the [[Arranger (comics)|Arranger]], the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]\'s lieutenant. The Arranger used the [[Persuader (comics)|Persuader]] to brainwash the [[Punisher]] into attempting an assassination of the Lobo Brothers. The plan failed thanks to [[Spider-Man]]\'s interference and the iron will of the Punisher, who ended up killing the Persuader instead. The Lobo Brothers knew who was responsible for the attempt and they vowed revenge.<ref>\'\'Web of Spider-Man\'\' #47-53</ref>\n\nThe Lobo Brothers moved to New York and began to slaughter the Kingpin\'s men and they leave messages in blood at the murder scenes which say things like "Kingpin: Wolves Bite Back" and "Kingpin: Wolves Kill."{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nSoon after arriving in New York and in the Daily Bugle, Eduardo bumped into [[Glory Grant]], secretary of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], and plans to seduce her into getting the newspaper files of the Kingpin which he secretly steals.<ref>\'\'The Spectacular Spider-Man #146\'\'</ref><ref>\'\'The Spectacular Spider-Man #150\'\'</ref>\n\nAs the Gang War accelerates, Glory discovers that Eduardo is a werewolf. The Lobo Brothers arranged a meeting with the Kingpin until [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] crash the meeting as well as the appearance of Spider-Man. During the battle, Glory gets her hands on the Arranger\'s gun loaded with silver bullets. As Spider-Man and Eduardo clash, Gloria kills Eduardo claiming she was aiming at Spider-Man and missed. Carlos Lobo was knocked unconscious and was presumably arrested and imprisoned.<ref>\'\'Web of Spider-Man\'\' #55</ref> Eduardo\'s body was returned to Texas to be buried.<ref>\'\'Web of Spider-Man\'\' #56</ref>\n\nSometime later, Carlos was eventually released (or escaped) and along his sister Esmeralda started to run a new criminal organization - the Lobo Cartel in Mexico. Among their illicit operations, in at least one occasion they agreed to human trafficking to supply the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]]\'s request of "living test subjects". The Cartel filled a truck with people that they intended to deliver to Roxxon at Houston Harbor. However, at the behest of a mysterious old man called \'\'Mr. Moctezuma\'\' (sharply dressed and always in the company of a coyote animal), the Cartel let a girl called [[Hummingbird (comics)|Aracely]] be placed at the last minute with to those in the truck and then purposefully left them to be cooked alive by the desert sun inside the metallic container before departing for Houston.\n\nAfter Aracely turned out to have survived this ordeal and a mystically-empowered enforcer of Mr. Moctezuma called the Salamander, who was attempting to kill her, lost to the [[Scarlet Spider]] who was protecting her, the Lobo siblings were called to finish her.\n\nWith Mr. Moctezuma\'s promise of a reward to each of them (which Carlos planned to use to revive Eduardo) the siblings traveled to Houston and began to intimidate the local criminal gangs into helping them locate the girl. When they find her, Carlos and Esmeralda are confronted by her companion, [[Kaine Parker|Kaine the Scarlet Spider]], but they easily manage to overpower and kill him.<ref>\'\'Scarlet Spider\'\' Vol 2 #13</ref>\n\nThey pursue savagely after Aracely, who uses her mind powers and trickery to evade them for a while. When the Lobo manage to catch her, they reveal that Aracely is rumored to be "a possible reincarnation of [[Huitzilopochtli]]": the Aztec God of War. Esmeralda considers the possibility of using her to their favor, but Carlos refuses to go against the wishes of Mr. Moctezuma, because he "returned them their powers" and can revive Eduardo. They are interrupted by a vicious gang of thugs called "the Sharks", whose territory Aracely has cleverly lead them to. The thugs proceed to brawl with the werewolves while Aracely manipulates emotions to exacerbate the fight. The plan doesn\'t work for too long and the Lobo gain the upper hand. The siblings track Aracely through her scent and capture her again, concluding this time that she is too much trouble and should just proceed to kill her. However, they are again interrupted, this time by Kaine who the wolves kill. However, Karine, accepted "The Other" to save Aracely and is reborn as a spider monster.<ref>\'\'Scarlet Spider\'\' Vol 2 #14</ref>\n\nKaine severely beats up Carlos and Esmeralda who are unable to separate his presence from the spiders that accompany him. Esmeralda exclaims that they are not afraid of him, saying he is not the only monster they have met and have even seen [[Mictlan]]. But the monster Kaine is now is relentless, focused only on his "prey" and ends up ripping out Carlo\'s eye and ripping off his arm. Esmeralda then grabs Carlos\' body and flees back to Mexico.<ref>\'\'Scarlet Spider\'\' Vol 2 #15</ref>\n\nFollowing the fight with Scarlet Spider, Carlos is in a bed-ridden state as he and Esmeralda are approached again by Mr. Moctezuma. He proceeds to punish their failure by effortlessly tossing Esmeralda aside with a single hand and killing Carlos with what appears to be a breath spell to "reunite him with Eduardo" as he had promised. Mr. Moctezuma lifts her by the neck and tells her that "the Hummingbird is alive. I need her dead for the [[Five Suns|Sixth Creation]] to begin." Esmeralda begs him for an opportunity to kill the girl again. Mr. Moctezuma refuses, tosses her aside again and professes that:\n\n{{quotation|She knows now. Huitzilopochtli awakens, I can feel him. And he will come to kill me for what I\'ve done. The girl, her spider... I will be ready for all of them}}\n\nMr. Moctezuma then reveals a group of people that appear to be mystically-empowered as the Salamander, each of them sharing attributes of an Aztec god.<ref>\'\'Scarlet Spider\'\' Vol. 2 #15</ref>\n\nDuring the "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" storyline, Eduardo Lobo was cloned by [[Ben Reilly|Jackal]] and his company New U Technologies.<ref>\'\'Clone Conspiracy\'\' #2</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs mutants who shared the same powers, the Lobo brothers possessed the ability to transform themselves into humanoid wolves. Carlos can turn into a brown-furred werewolf while Eduardo can turn into a black-furred werewolf. They possessed razor-sharp claws and fangs, as well as superhuman senses, strength, speed, reflexes/reactions, agility, and durability enough to battle Spider-Man in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nEven in their human forms, they possessed exceptional strength and agility, as Eduardo once protected Gloria from a [[forklift]] that had been possessed by one of the demons released during the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] storyline and turned into a monster, destroying it with one blow.\n\n==In other media==\n* Eduardo Lobo appears in the [[video game]] \'\'[[Spider-Man and Captain America in Doctor Doom\'s Revenge]]\'\' as a [[boss (video game)|boss character]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Lobo%2C_Carlos Carlos Lobo] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Lobo_Brothers_(Earth-616) Lobo Brothers] at Marvel Wiki\n** [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Carlos_Lobo_(Earth-616) Carlos Lobo] at Marvel Wiki\n** [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Eduardo_Lobo_(Earth-616) Eduardo Lobo] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/lobo_brothers.html Lobo Brothers] at SpiderFan.org\n* [http://comicvine.gamespot.com/carlos-lobo/4005-29189/ Carlos Lobo] at Comic Vine\n* [http://comicvine.gamespot.com/eduardo-lobo/4005-29188/ Eduardo Lobo] at Comic Vine\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/lobocarlosspdrmn.htm Carlos Lobo] at Marvel Appendix\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/loboeduardospdrmn.htm Eduardo Lobo] at Marvel Appendix\n\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Fictional lycanthropes]]\n[[Category:Fictional twins]]\n[[Category:Fictional Mexican people]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Puebla]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gerry Conway]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]'

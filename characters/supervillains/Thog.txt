This is only the case in his subsequent appearances. In his first appearance, he was initially bat-like, and when harmed by Man-Thing, Thog later took on a more human form, and only shadows and angle choices protected his modesty.<ref>\'\'Fear\'\' #11</ref>\n\nThog, along with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Satannish]], were alleged to be manifestations of Satan\'s evil and power. However, he is autonomous from said beings with a unique appearance, personality and traits.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' (vol. 1) #100</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThog can fire magical energy bolts. Like most demons, Thog is more powerful in his realm where he can alter its reality. He is assumed to be immortal after surviving even Man-Thing\'s fiery touch.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Thog Thog] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Thog_%28Earth-616%29 Thog] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/thog/4005-13998/ Thog] at Comic Vine\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/thog.htm|Thog}}\n\n{{Steve Gerber}}\n{{Man-Thing}}\n{{Marvel Mystic}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1972]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Gerber]]\n[[Category:Fictional demons and devils]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics demons]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}\n\n[[fr:Liste de d\xc3\xa9mons dans l\'univers Marvel#Thog]]'

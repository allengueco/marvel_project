He is a prominent member of the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], a team of aliens who work for [[Thanos]].\n\nCorvus Glaive appears as one of the Children of Thanos in the 2018 film \'\'[[Avengers: Infinity War]]\'\', portrayed by [[Michael James Shaw]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe character was created by [[Jonathan Hickman]] and [[Jim Cheung]] and first appeared in \'\'Infinity: Free Comic Book Day\'\' (May 2013).\n\nThe character has described by Hickman as "Thanos\' most favored. Corvus is cruel, arrogant and the most loyal of the Black Order. A warrior who betrayed his people and sold his soul to Thanos to pursue a different kind of glory."<ref name="corvus-cbr">{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Sunu |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=45325 |title=EXCLUSIVE: Introducing the Generals of Marvel\'s "Infinity" |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=May 6, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nEditor [[Tom Breevort]] has said:\n\n{{quote|He was the one character among the generals who was designed by Jim, and he was designed by Jim specifically because this story was being done and Jim had to get to him first. In essence, this is no different than any other design challenge. Jonathan laid the particulars of the characters out on the table, Jim went to town and did a few designs \xe2\x80\x94 different roughs for the head and so forth. We selected from that and away he went. He\'s the most prominent of the five lieutenants. He\'s Thanos\' second-in-command and the one who most readily speaks for him, and yet you want him to have a certain amount of visual contrast to Thanos. While Thanos is a fairly big, blocky character and really became that over the years, Corvus \xe2\x80\x94 he\'s not skinny, but he\'s more slender, more lithe, more wiry \xe2\x80\x94 sort of in reflection of the glaive weapon that he carries. He\'s like the physical personification of that in a sense.<ref name="corvus-cbr" />}}\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nCorvus Glaive is a member of [[Thanos]]\' [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]]. He was chosen for his mastery in combat and tactical abilities and thus was chosen to lead them. He is also the husband of fellow order member [[Proxima Midnight]].

The characters first appear as a group in [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] #4 (Oct. 1998) and were created by [[Dan Jurgens]] and [[John Romita Jr]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe first of the Dark Gods, [[Perrikus]] debuted in \'\'[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]\'\' vol. 2, #1 (July 1998), and the majority of the group featured in \'\'Thor\'\' #4\xe2\x80\x935 (Oct. \xe2\x80\x93 Nov. 1998) until an extended storyline in \'\'Thor\'\' #7\xe2\x80\x9312 (Jan. \xe2\x80\x93 June 1999). The characters returned to Marvel continuity in \'\'Thor\'\' #42\xe2\x80\x9343 (Dec. 2001 \xe2\x80\x93 Jan. 2002) and #53 (Oct. 2002).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe first Dark God, Perrikus, appears when accidentally freed from a prison in [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] by the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Not knowing what has occurred, Thor departs and Perrikus brings his brethren to Asgard. The core group are Perrikus (god of "Power Unlimited and Energy Infinite"); Majeston Zelia (the leader and Perrikus\' mother); Adva (god of Portals and Knowledge); D\'Chel (god of Illusion); Tokkots (god of Rhyme) and Slototh (god of Filth). With an army they invade and overrun Asgard, capturing [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], Thor\'s father and the ruler of the [[Norse paganism|Norse]] gods.\n\nRevealed to be the evil opposites of the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods, the Dark Gods first invaded Asgard over a millennium ago after an [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardian]] scout called Lonkarr found and investigated the city of the Dark Gods. While there, Lonkarr was attacked by Tserron\xe2\x80\x94the wife of Perrikus\xe2\x80\x94whom he killed in combat. Perrikus then led the Dark Gods after Lonkarr to Asgard where the two factions entered into a full-scale war. Although thwarted, the Dark Gods now seek revenge. The now-adult Thor battles Perrikus and during combat slices the Thunder God\'s hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] in half with his own weapon. Despite this setback, Thor regroups, and with the aid of fellow immortal [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and the Asgardian [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] defeats Perrikus and the Dark Gods.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' vol. 2, #1 (July 1998); #4 - 5 (Oct. - Nov. 1998); #7 - 12 (Jan. - June 1999)</ref>\n\n[[Desak]] the God Slayer eventually finds and slaughters the surviving Dark Gods, and only Perrikus and Adva (god of Portals and Knowledge) escape.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' vol. 2, #42 - 43 (Dec. 2001 - Jan. 2002)</ref> The pair eventually battle Thor at the direction of [[Zarrko]] the Tomorrow Man, although both concede defeat when Thor severs Perrikus\'s right arm with the [[Bloodaxe (comics)|Bloodaxe]]. Perrikus and Adva retreat and have yet to reappear.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' vol. 2, #53 (Oct. 2002)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Gods_(Pantheon)_(Earth-616) Dark Gods] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Thor}}\n{{Marvel Comics deities}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1998]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics deities]]\n\n\n{{Marvel-Comics-stub}}'

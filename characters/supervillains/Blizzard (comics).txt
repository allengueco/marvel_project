b'\'\'\'Blizzard\'\'\' is a fictional character, a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as a member of [[Iron Man]]\'s [[rogues gallery]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}\nCreated by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]], the Gregor Shapanka version of Blizzard appeared as Jack Frost in \'\'[[Tales of Suspense]]\'\' #45 (September 1963), and as Blizzard beginning in \'\'[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]\'\' #86 (May 1976). He was killed off in \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] Annual\'\' #20 (November 1986).\n\nThe Donnie Gill Blizzard first appeared in \'\'[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]\'\' #223 (October 1987) and was created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Bob Layton]].\n\nThe Randy Macklin version of Blizzard first appeared in the \'\'[[Marvel Holiday Special]]\'\' #2 (January 1993) and was created by Sholly Fisch and [[Tom Morgan (comics)|Tom Morgan]].\n\n=={{anchor|Fictional character biography}}Fictional character biographies==\n===Gregor Shapanka===\n{{Infobox comics character\n<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| character_name = Blizzard\n| image          = <!-- filename format only -->\n| imagesize      = <!-- default 250 -->\n| caption        = \n| publisher      = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| debut          = \'\'\'As Jack Frost:\'\'\'<br>\'\'[[Tales of Suspense]]\'\' #45 (September 1963)<br>\'\'\'As Blizzard:\'\'\'<br>\'\'[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]\'\' #86 (May 1976)\n| first_series   = \n| first_episode  = \n| first_comic    = \n| creators       = \'\'\'Jack Frost:\'\'\'<br>[[Stan Lee]]<br>[[Don Heck]]<br>\'\'\'Blizzard:\'\'\'<br>[[Bill Mantlo]]<br>[[George Tuska]]\n| voiced_by      = \n| based_on       = \n| alter_ego      = \n| full_name      = Gregor Shapanka\n| species        = Human\n| homeworld      = <!-- optional -->\n| alliances      = <!-- optional -->\n| partners       = <!-- optional -->\n| supports       = <!-- optional -->\n| aliases        = Jack Frost\n| powers         = Micro-circuited suit grants:<br>Cold manipulation and projection\n| cat            = \n| subcat         = \n| hero           = \n| villain        = \n| sortkey        = \n| addcharcat#    = \n|}}\nGregor Shapanka is a Hungarian scientist obsessed with immortality, and decides that the study of [[cryonics]] is the first step towards his goal. Shapanka takes a job at [[Stark Industries]] to fund his research and attempts to steal directly from [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. After being caught and fired by Tony Stark for trying to steal from Tony Stark\'s secret vault, Gregor creates a suit containing cold-generating devices and is dubbed by the papers as "Jack Frost." He attempts to raid Stark Industries where he captures [[Pepper Potts]] and [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]], but is defeated by Iron Man.<ref>\'\'Tales of Suspense\'\' #45 (Sept. 1963)</ref>\n\nSeveral years later, Gregor Shapanka escaped prison and attacked Stark\'s Long Island industrial complex using a new far more powerful cold-generating battle-suit and calling himself the Blizzard. This time, Blizzard was out to steal Stark\'s climatron device which could be used to alter weather patterns. Blizzard nearly froze Iron Man to death, but Iron Man was rescued by Potts. Iron Man caused Blizzard\'s battle-suit to short-circuit and then captured him.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #86 - 87 (Apr. - May 1976)</ref>\n\nGregor Shapanka obtained financing for recreating his cold-generating costume from multimillionaire [[Justin Hammer]]. Blizzard formed a partnership with two other clients of Hammer known as [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]] and [[Melter]]. Together, the three criminals attacked a hotel casino in Atlantic City, only to be defeated by Iron Man and private bodyguard [[Bethany Cabe]].<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #123</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, Shapanka reconstructs his cold suit in prison. When [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] uses his electrical powers to break out of the adjoining cell Shapanka is caught in the blast and the suit is fused to his body. Electro and the Blizzard then join forces to take over the \'\'[[Daily Bugle]]\'\', but are stopped by [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].<ref>\'\'Marvel Team-Up\'\' #56 (Apr. 1977)</ref>\n\nSome months later during the \'\'[[Demon in a Bottle]]\'\' storyline, Justin Hammer hires the Blizzard to join an army of supervillains and battle Iron Man.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #127 (Oct. 1979)</ref>\n\nBlizzard\'s body somehow gained the ability to generate intense cold without artificial means. Feeling alienated from humanity, Shapanka (again calling himself Jack Frost) went to live in an ice palace he created within a mountain. [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] found Jack Frost\'s new home and destroyed the ice palace. Jack Frost was seemingly killed in the collapse of his ice domain.<ref>\'\'Hulk\'\' #249</ref>\n\nGregor Shapanka reappeared in the guise of the Blizzard. Somehow, Blizard had lost his bodily power to generate cold and once again needed his battlesuit to create low temperatures. Shapanka returned to crime and formed a gang to aid him. However, upon robbing a bank in New York City, Blizzard and his henchmen were found and defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and were taken into police custody. Thanks to his lawyer, Blizzard was soon back at large and kidnapped Bobby Saunders (a boy whom he saw speaking with Spider-Man). Through Saunders, Blizzard intended to get revenge for his most recent defeat. Blizzard mistakes a [[Iron Man 2020|villainous version of Iron Man from the year 2020]] for the modern Iron Man and attempts to ambush him. The future Iron Man however is on an urgent mission to find Bobby Saunders (who would grow up to be a terrorist in 2020) and instantly kills the Blizzard with a repulsor blast.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man Annual\'\' #20 (1986)</ref>\n\n===Donald Gill===\n{{Infobox comics character\n<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| character_name = Blizzard\n| image          = [[File:BlizzardDonnieGill.jpg|250px]]\n| imagesize      = <!-- default 250 -->\n| caption        = Art by [[Rick Leonardi]]\n| publisher      = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| debut          = \'\'[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]\'\' #223 (October 1987)\n| first_series   = \n| first_episode  = \n| first_comic    = \n| creators       = [[David Michelinie]]<br>[[Bob Layton]]\n| voiced_by      = \n| based_on       = \n| alter_ego      = \n| full_name      = Donald "Donnie" Gill\n| species        = [[Inhumans|Inhuman]]\n| homeworld      = <!-- optional -->\n| alliances      = [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]<br>[[Masters of Evil]]<br>[[Justin Hammer|Hammer Industries]]\n| partners       = <!-- optional -->\n| supports       = <!-- optional -->\n| aliases        = <!-- optional -->\n| powers         =*Ice generation and projection\n*Superhuman strength, speed, and agility\n*Electricity manipulation\n| cat            = \n| subcat         = \n| hero           = \n| villain        = \n| sortkey        = \n| addcharcat#    = \n|}}\nBorn in Delaware, Donald "Donnie" Gill was a professional criminal hired by [[Justin Hammer]] (who gave him a cryogenic suit resembling the original [[Blizzard (comics)#Gregor Shapanka|Blizzard]]\'s suit). Since Blizzard was vaporized by Iron Man 2020, Donnie adopted the name. His first mission involved working with [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] and [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]] to capture [[Force (comics)|Force]], who had betrayed Hammer. However, Blizzard was clumsy and annoyed his teammates with his amateurish mistakes (such as creating an ice wall blocking the path to their objective). After encasing Blacklash in ice, the trio fled as reinforcements arrived to protect Force.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #223-224</ref>\n\nThe trio again tried to capture Force, who was protected by [[Iron Man]]. Although Blizzard fought better, when Force entered the fight he neutralized the villains\' powers. Blizzard, Beetle, and Blacklash split up, fled and rested until their powers returned. Force found Blizzard, whose powers were ineffective against him so Blizzard fought him with bare hands. Force repelled him, blasting him through a wall. Blizzard doggedly tried to blast Force again (despite warnings), and was electrocuted. The Beetle and Blacklash abandoned Blizzard; Chemistro blamed them for their failures, and they were arrested.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nBefore Blizzard could be jailed, he was rescued by [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] for Hammer. His loyalty to Hammer increased, although Iron Man tried to mentor him. Hammer negotiated with Iron Man for Blizzard, forcing the latter to help him take down the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]].<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #239-240</ref> Iron Man agreed, but Blizzard refused to believe that Hammer betrayed him. After hearing a recording, Blizzard was crushed; he surrendered to Iron Man, and was saved by Chemistro and Melter.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nAfter solo missions against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]{{Issue|date=August 2009}} and the [[New Warriors]],{{Issue|date=August 2009}} attending the [[AIM (comics)|AIM Weapons Expo]] with several other super-villains{{Issue|date=August 2009}} and joining the largest group of the [[Masters of Evil]],{{Issue|date=August 2009}} Blizzard worked with a smaller team (including villains [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] and daughters of [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]] and [[Batroc the Leaper]]). Their mission failed after interference from [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] and his allies.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}\n\nBlizzard attacked [[She-Hulk]] in a bar; instead of defeating him, she invited him for a drink. Drunk, he contemplated his lack of recognition. Before collapsing in a stupor, Blizzard noted that he liked She-Hulk. After reverting to her Jennifer Walters persona she collapsed, vomiting, on top of him.<ref>\'\'She-Hulk\'\' #1 (2004)</ref>\n\nWith the Avengers disbanded, the Beetle (now known as [[Abner Jenkins|Mach-IV]]) decided to form a new group of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Like the original Thunderbolts, they were former villains seeking redemption for their crimes as superheroes. Gill was one of the first members invited to join by Mach-IV, and he agreed.<ref name="New Thunderbolts #1">\'\'New Thunderbolts\'\' #1</ref> However, he lacked confidence despite his desire to help people. As a Thunderbolt, Blizzard fought several enemies, including [[Fathom Five (comics)|Fathom Five]],<ref name="New Thunderbolts #1"/> the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]]<ref>\'\'New Thunderbolts\'\' #2</ref> and the [[Purple Man]].<ref>\'\'New Thunderbolts\'\' #12</ref>\n\nBlizzard and fellow Thunderbolt [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]] became close friends. When Speed Demon tried to commit crimes with the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], Blizzard convinced him to use his former Whizzer outfit and a tracking device. Angry with Blizzard, Speed Demon tied him upside-down and naked on a bridge.<ref>\'\'New Thunderbolts\'\' #8</ref> Although doubting his status as a superhero and feeling hopeless, Blizzard gained strength from the others (especially [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], who insulted him and dismissed him from the group when she became its leader).{{Issue|date=August 2009}}\n\n[[Baron Zemo]], forming a group to fight Songbird\'s Thunderbolts, recruited Blizzard (who spent his days in bars after his firing by Songbird). His new teammate, the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]], enhanced Blizzard\'s abilities.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} He battled the Thunderbolts; the groups were soon assimilated, and Blizzard helped them against the [[U-Foes]] during [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #103</ref> Against [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]], Blizzard proved himself to his teammates by shielding them (and Songbird).{{Issue|date=August 2009}}\n\nIn the final battle against the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], Blizzard\'s suit was destroyed after the Wellspring energy was released<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #108</ref> and he was pardoned for his past crimes.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #109</ref> Blizzard later appeared as an inmate at the Raft.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #156</ref>\n\nBlizzard later aligns himself with Iron Man, [[Zeke Stane]], [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], and [[Living Laser]] against [[Mandarin (comics)|the Mandarin]] but is defeated by the Mandarin\'s forces.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #526 (November 2012)</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]\'\' storyline, Blizzard was seen with Whirlwind robbing banks when they are approached by Spymaster. Blizzard and Whirlwind are recruited by Spymaster to join him and his villain allies (consisting of [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]] IV, [[Titanium Man]], [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]], and Whiplash IV) in a plot to attack the almost-defenseless Stark Tower. During the briefing, Blizzard suddenly collapses.<ref>\'\'Infinity: Heist\'\' #1</ref> When Blizzard regains consciousness, he discovers that his skin has turned white and he can generate ice on his own. Blizzard had been exposed to the [[Terrigen Mist]]s unleashed upon the face of the entire Earth by [[Black Bolt]]. Being unknowingly an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] descendant, Blizzard experienced Terrigenesis which causes the manifestation of his latent powers. Blizzard thought that this was his opportunity to "be part of something bigger" and decided to leave Spymaster\'s team. However, he and Whirlwind were brutally attacked by Spymaster and Titanium Man when they tried to leave.<ref>\'\'Infinity: Heist\'\' #2</ref> Blizzard and Whirlwind were forced into taking part of the assault to Stark Tower. After Spymaster used teleporter discs to teleport some Iron Man Armors to the buyers, he escaped and left Blizzard and the rest of his accomplices to be discovered by the heroes which were using the tower as a base. They managed to defeat the heroes, and they were offered to be taken to Spymaster by Titanium Man. When they arrived to a spaceship where Spymaster was, they were ambushed by him and Titanium Man who revealed himself as [[Captain Atlas]] of the [[Kree]] (who were the masterminds behind the heist).<ref>\'\'Infinity: Heist\'\' #3</ref> Blizzard and the other villains managed to escape custody and started fighting Spymaster, Titanium Man and the army of Iron Men (controlled by Spymaster). The actual Iron Man arrived to the spaceship, after having tracked down the armors, and helped Blizzard and his allies defeat the enemies. During the fight, Blizzard used the powers he discovered of being like a human battery to overcharge the armors and deactivate them, but he fainted and fell off the spaceship\'s cargo door. A suit Iron Man was controlling rescued him, but in order to let his friends escape, Blizzard froze himself and the suit. Blizzard was taken to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and was left under the simulation he had been delivered to the Inhumans in order to prove himself as the changed man Blizzard thought he was....until S.H.I.E.L.D. could know what to do with him.<ref name="Infinity: Heist #4">\'\'Infinity: Heist\'\' #4</ref>\n\n===Randy Macklin===\n{{Infobox comics character\n<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| character_name = Blizzard\n| image          = \n| imagesize      = \n| caption        = \n| publisher      = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| debut          = \'\'[[Marvel Holiday Special]]\'\' #2 (January 1993)\n| first_series   = \n| first_episode  = \n| first_comic    = \n| creators       = Sholly Fisch<br>[[Tom Morgan (comics)|Tom Morgan]]\n| voiced_by      = \n| based_on       = \n| alter_ego      = \n| full_name      = Randall "Randy" Macklin\n| species        = Human\n| homeworld      = <!-- optional -->\n| alliances      = \n| partners       = <!-- optional -->\n| supports       = <!-- optional -->\n| aliases        = <!-- optional -->\n| powers         = Cryokinesis\n| cat            = \n| subcat         = \n| hero           = \n| villain        = \n| sortkey        = \n| addcharcat#    = \n|}}\nRandall "Randy" Macklin, an ex-criminal, fails to find work following his release from prison and uses a spare Blizzard costume he was safeguarding for his friend Donnie Gill.

Micro-circuited cryogenic units make it possible to emit freezing rays, which lower the temperature of the surrounding air (or objects) and release ice as a projectile.\n\nDonnie Gill\'s costume is upgraded by supervillains [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] and [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]]. This enables even greater manipulation of cold where Gill can encase people in snow and ice, create an ice barricade or generate "ice sleds" for transport. Following his Terrigenesis, Blizzard also developed electricity manipulation where he can manipulate electrical currents and charge the energies in his body.<ref name="Infinity: Heist #4"/>\n\n==Other versions==\n===House of M: Masters of Evil===\nIn the \'\'[[House of M]]\'\' reality, the Donnie Gill version of Blizzard appears as a member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]\'s Masters of Evil.<ref>\'\'House of M: Masters of Evil\'\' #1</ref>\n\n===Power Pack===\nThe Donnie Gill version of Blizzard appears in \'\'[[Power Pack#All ages miniseries|Iron Man & Power Pack]]\'\' issue #2 with Speed Demon. He kidnaps Irena Crumb (daughter of millionaire Arnold Crumb, and a school rival of [[Julie Power]]\'s) from her school and takes her to an abandoned warehouse across town, where he tortures her. Speed Demon runs in, telling him that Power Pack has found them; Power Pack bursts in, and a fight ensues. At one point, Blizzard freezes the ground, causing Speed Demon to slip and smash into him. The Pack captures Blizzard, and [[Julie Power|Lightspeed]] takes his mask so she can rescue Irena from Speed Demon incognito. Afterwards, Blizzard and Speed Demon are arrested.<ref>\'\'Iron Man & Power Pack\'\' #2 (2007)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* The Gregor Shapanka version of Blizzard appears as "Jack Frost" in the Iron Man segment of \'\'[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]\'\', voiced by [[Chris Wiggins]].{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n* The Gregor Shapanka version of Blizzard appears in \'\'[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]\'\', voiced by [[Chuck McCann]] (primary) and by [[Neil Ross]] (in the episode "The Beast Within").{{cn|date=November 2017}} He is shown as a servant of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]. In the episode "And the Dead Shall Give up the Sea", Mandarin scolded him for an incident where Blizzard chilled his drink which accidentally killed Mandarin\'s begonias in the process. After nearly letting Blizzard hit the bottom of the pit he manifested, Mandarin sent Blizzard to replant his begonias. Like Mandarin\'s other underlings, Blizzard got his own suit of exo-armor which popped up from time to time in the series. In the episode "The Beast Within", Blizzard and Hypnotia target Tony Stark\'s airplane. In the episode "The Armor Wars" Pt. 1, both Blizzard and Blacklash had their exo-armors targeted by [[Iron Man]]. Iron Man neutralized them both during an airplane skyjacking. He appeared in the two-part series finale "Hands of the Mandarin" with a new exo-armor alongside Blacklash, Hypnotia and Whirlwind. Mandarin later used his energy to help power the Heart of Darkness only to be freed by Iron Man. He was sent to jail again with the other villains.\n* The Donnie Gill version of Blizzard appears in \'\'[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]\'\', voiced by [[David Orth]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} This version is a cryogenics scientist and a former employee of [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]], but became deformed on one side of his face due to Stane, and vowed to get revenge. Like Iron Man, Blizzard wears a technological suit which enables him to freeze objects. In the episode "Cold War", Iron Man teams up with Blizzard, but eventually discovers that Blizzard was actually a criminal, and was creating a freezing weapon for Stane. After a battle, Blizzard is cryogenically frozen. In the episode "Best Served Cold", Stane unfreezes him and forces him to find a cure for his own daughter [[Madame Masque|Whitney Stane]] by planting a bomb on his armor. Blizzard manages to break free however and has his revenge on Stane. Blizzard is then defeated by Iron Man. In the episode "Invincible Iron Man: Reborn", he, [[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]], and [[Fixer (comics)|Mr. Fix]] come under the services of [[Justin Hammer]]. The three of them attempt to kill Iron Man (who survived Whiplash\'s attack) and [[War Machine]], but the trio are defeated. Later in the episode "Titanium vs Iron", Blizzard cools [[Justin Hammer]]\'s burning [[Titanium Man]] armor and witnesses Mr. Fix\'s "death" at the hands of Hammer. Blizzard says that Justin Hammer "killed him in cold blood" which Hammer tells him "yes and no" and uploads a flash drive containing Mr. Fix\'s conscious into the Hammer Multinational mainframe. In the episode "Hostile Takeover", Blizzard is seen robbing a jewelry store only to be stopped by Iron Man. In the episode "The Hammer Falls", Blizzard is mentioned to have been taken down by a mysterious figure (later revealed to be Justin Hammer in the Titanium Man armor).\n* The Donnie Gill version of Blizzard appears in \'\'[[The Avengers: Earth\'s Mightiest Heroes]]\'\', voiced by [[Troy Baker]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} This version is a full-armored villain in a parka.

Aboard \'\'Mirabel Del Mar\'\', Gill freezes the boat captain in order to send a message to Hydra that he refuses their offer. Sunil Bakshi arrives and uses a trigger phrase to reactivate Gill\'s mind-control. Gill is ordered by Sunil to ice everyone on the ship to make sure that nobody leaves alive, but as Gill tries to freeze the ship, he is sniped by Skye as his body is frozen upon falling into the water.

However, he gave the police the slip minutes later (thanks to hiding a stolen diamond in Peter\'s bookbag) and follows Peter where Macklin acquires a Cryogenic Gauntlet from Harry Osborn and uses the gem to power up the weapon. Dubbing himself the Blizzard, Macklin gained the upper hand on Hammerhead\'s gang until Spider-Man gets involved. In the short time amassed, the gauntlet seemingly starts to mutate Macklin as his power increases and puts Manhattan in an Ice Age. With help from the thermal technology he acquired from Harry, Spider-Man was able to subdue Blizzard, disarm him of the Cryogenic Gauntlet, and leaves him for the police.\n\n===Video games===\n* The Gregor Shapanka version of Blizzard appears as a boss in \'\'[[The Invincible Iron Man (video game)|The Invincible Iron Man]]\'\'.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n* The Donnie Gill version of Blizzard is featured as a boss and a playable character in \'\'[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]\'\'.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n* The Donnie Gill version of Blizzard appears in \'\'[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]\'\', voiced by [[Michael Benyaer]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://marvel.wikia.com/Gregor_Shapanka_%28Earth-616%29 Bliizard (Gregor Shapanka)] Marvel Wiki\n*[http://www.comicvine.com/blizzard-shapanka/4005-86265/ Bliizard (Gregor Shapanka)] at Comic Vine\n*{{Marvelwiki|Blizzard_(Donald_Gill)|Blizzard (Donnie Gill)}}\n*{{Marveldatabase|Donald Gill (Earth-616)|Blizzard (Donnie Gill)}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=437|title=Blizzard (Donnie Gill)}}\n*[http://www.comicvine.com/blizzard/4005-4808/ Blizzard (Donnie Gill)] at Comic Vine\n*[http://marvel.wikia.com/Randall_Macklin_%28Earth-616%29 Blizzard (Randall Macklin)] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Iron Man}}\n{{Inhumans}}\n{{Thunderbolts}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional characters with ice or cold abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries]]\n<!--Gregor Shapanka-->\n[[Category:Characters created by Don Heck]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1963]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n <!--Donnie Gill-->\n[[Category:Characters created by David Michelinie]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1987]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Delaware]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics television characters]]\n<!--Randy Macklin-->\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1994]]\n[[Category:Inhumans]]'

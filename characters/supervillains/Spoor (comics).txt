He first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #300 and was a member of the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]]. His real name was established in ''[[Excalibur (comic book)|Excalibur]]'' #89. Spoor is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to secrete pheromones, allowing him to control others.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAndrew Hamish Grave's mutation was already visible at a young age. His father was abusive and blamed the child's mother for birthing a mutant. He killed his wife and told the child that his mother had left them. His father forced the child to eat garbage and when he grew up, he developed an intense hatred of both himself and all humans. He discovered his mutant power to release mood-altering pheromones, allowing him to control others and used these powers to have people kill each other.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nTaking the name Spoor, he was recruited by [[Fabian Cortez]] into the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], a group of mutants following the philosophy of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] that mutants are superior to humans. As part of the Acolytes, Spoor was involved in an attack on a hospital and killed many human patients. In a fight with the British X-team called [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], Spoor tried to manipulate [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] into killing him, but Nightcrawler managed to resist. It turned out that Spoor hated himself just as much as he hated humans; in his mind he felt that killing humans was wrong and that he therefore deserved to be killed himself.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\n===Prisoner===\nFor a time, he was a prisoner of Excalibur and stayed on [[Muir Island]]. Excalibur ally [[Ahab (comics)|Doctor Rory Campbell]] wanted to cure Spoor, but during the treatment Rory's latent hatred of mutants got the better of him and Spoor manipulated Rory into an aggressive attack on him. The aggression-tracking automatic security systems in Spoor's cell, known as the Pen, activated and a laser beam severed one of Campbell's legs. Spoor remained on Muir Island for a while, but was then transferred to a facility on the main land. He later escaped and went to [[Genosha]], which was by that time ruled by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. He died in the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] attack on the island.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\n===Necrosha===\nSpoor was later resurrected by Eli Bard during the Necrosha event when he caused a mass resurrection on the island of deceased mutants.<ref>''X-Force'' (Vol.3) #21</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nSpoor's primary ability was his production of mood-altering, airborne pheromones that heightened the aggression of others around him. He could direct this aggression, but would often leave it uncontrolled, hoping that his victims would turn against him as well. His physical mutations, possibly bestial in nature, thickly covered his whole body with long hair and may have possibly given him superhuman animal-like abilities.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Andrew_Graves_(Earth-616) Spoor] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spoor (comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita Jr.]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Scott Lobdell]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]"

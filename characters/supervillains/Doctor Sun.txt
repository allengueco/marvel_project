He is a [[cyborg]] who fed on human [[blood]], and has come into conflict with [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and the [[Fantastic Four]].\n\n==Publication history==\nDoctor Sun first appeared in ''[[Tomb of Dracula]]'' #16-17 (January\xe2\x80\x93February 1974), and was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Gene Colan]].\n\nThe character subsequently appeared in ''The Tomb of Dracula'' #19-21 (April\xe2\x80\x93June 1974), #26-28 (November 1974-January 1975), #37-42 (October 1975-March 1976), ''Doctor Strange'' #14 (May 1976), ''The Man Called Nova'' #22-25 (1979), ''Fantastic Four'' #206 (May 1979). #208-209 (July\xe2\x80\x93August 1979), and #217 (April 1980).\n\nDoctor Sun received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #17.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nDoctor Sun was born in [[Peking]], [[People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of China]], and was working as a scientist during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Sun devised a program whereby a [[human]] [[brain]] could be removed from its body and supported indefinitely in a [[Life support|life support system]]. A political enemy managed to sentence Sun to death, then decided Sun should be the test subject of his own program.\n\nThe initial operation succeeded better than expected. Sun's disembodied brain was placed within a robotic chassis.  When Sun's [[mind]] was connected to a [[computer]] bank, he suddenly developed [[Psionics|psionic powers]]. He attacked the doctors, then forced the survivors to serve him. He kept his survival and powers a secret from the Chinese government and eventually left China completely.\n\nBecause of his dependence on human [[blood]], Dr. Sun became involved with the study of real [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]]s. He decided that a vampiric army could serve him and conquer the world, but first he needed to conquer the vampires. He fought both [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] and Blade a number of times, drained most of Dracula's powers, and even managed to kill him once, with the help of minion [[Lucas Brand]].<ref>''The Tomb of Dracula'', volume 1, No. 39, December 1975</ref>\n\nAfter Dracula revived and defeated his plans, Dr. Sun switched tactics. He discovered [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'s link to the [[supercomputer]]s of [[Xandar]]. He captured Nova and intended to plug into the computers from Earth. When [[Sphinx (comics)|the Sphinx]] commandeered Nova's ship directly to Xandar, Sun abandoned his body and invaded the Xandarian computers directly.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #206</ref> When the [[Fantastic Four]] later arrived with [[H.E.R.B.I.E.]], Sun downloaded into the robot's body.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #208</ref> Upon returning to Earth, he tried to destroy the FF by turning their headquarters against them. He took possession of the [[Baxter Building]]'s computer system. This freed H.E.R.B.I.E., who flew into the computer bank where Sun was isolated.  Dr. Sun was presumed destroyed in the resultant explosion.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #217</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDoctor Sun's disembodied brain has been placed within a robotic chassis. He gained psionic powers after his mind was connected to a computer bank.\nHis robotic body provided him with super strength and nigh invulnerabilty \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.marveldatabase.com/Doctor_Sun Doctor Sun] at the Marvel Database Project\n\n{{Dracula}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doctor Sun}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Gene Colan]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"

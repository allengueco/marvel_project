Her first appearance was in \'\'Generation X\'\' #53.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nNightwind trained as a [[Madripoor]] ninja, and learned to use her mutant power over Darkforce to shape a sword which she could use to kill or stun her opponents. She became a member of the Rising Sons with [[Dragonwing]], [[Spoilsport (comics)|Spoilsport]], Jet-Black, the Sign and Tough Love. The Rising Suns were hired to protect a man named Noy, who had in his possession a sword that was used to kill [[Adrienne Frost]]\'s husband.<ref>\'\'Generation X\'\' Vol 1 Issue 53</ref>\n\nAdrienne wanted the sword for herself and sent the [[mercenary]] [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] to get it, but the Rising Sons fought him off and left him for dead. Paladin returned alongside [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] members [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[Skin (Marvel Comics)|Skin]], [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]], [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] and [[Husk (comics)|Husk]].<ref>\'\'Generation X\'\' Vol 1 Issue 53</ref>\n\nThis led to a confrontation with Generation X where Nightwind [[ambush]]ed Chamber and almost killed him by knocking him out of an apartment window. She then jumped out of the window herself and boarded a train with Noy on it. When the Generation X members made their way onto the train and split up it was Synch and Skin who found her first. If not for Synch\'s ability to sense mutagenic auras they might have been killed, but Synch copied her powers to battle her. Although Synch was able to copy her powers he was unable to copy her skill and she proved herself to be the superior fighter to Synch. Before she was able to finish her battle Skin used his abilities to [[suffocation|suffocate]] her until she passed out.<ref>\'\'Generation X\'\' Vol 1 Issue 54</ref>\n\nWhen the [[mentally ill]] [[Scarlet Witch]] depowered over 90% of the world\'s mutant population on [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], Nightwind was among the many who lost her powers.<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' #18</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nNightwind is a mutant with the ability wield [[Darkforce]] energy. Generating darkforce into solid constructs she tends to create weaponry usually generating a [[katana|sword]] of the pitch-black energy which normally she uses for cutting, stabbing and the like, but she can also strike opponents with blows of non-lethal force that simply phase through living beings and disrupt their nervous system.<ref>\'\'Generation X\'\' Vol 1 Issue 53</ref> Nightwind is also capable of teleportation by traveling through the Darkforce Dimension. The distance at which she can travel is unknown as well if she can travel with others  but it is known that she can teleport between mid-air, and at a precise point such leaping off of a building and teleporting through the shadow before falling to her death only to "pop" up behind her opponents to surprise attack them.<ref>\'\'Generation X\'\' Vol 1 Issue 53</ref> She is able to use darkforce energy she draws upon to enhance her stealth and mask her movement. This is noted during a battle [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] and [[Skin (Marvel Comics)|Skin]] she was able to mask herself as she approached until just before her attack which was only sensed by Synch do to his own mutant aura sensing and synching to her powers.<ref>\'\'Generation X\'\' Vol 1 Issue 54</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/characters/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=754 Uncannyxmen.net character bio on Nightwind]\n\n[[Category:Fictional ninja]]\n[[Category:Fictional swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

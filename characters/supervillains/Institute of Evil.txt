The known members of the Institute of Evil included [[Ape-X]] (the leader), [[Doctor Decibel]], [[Foxfire (comics)|Foxfire]], [[Lamprey (comics)|Lamprey]], [[Quagmire (comics)|Quagmire]], and the [[Shape (comics)|Shape]].\n\nThe Behavior Modification process invented by Squadron member [[Tom Thumb (comics)#Squadron Supreme|Tom Thumb]] would prove to be the Institute of Evil\xe2\x80\x99s undoing. The [[Golden Archer]] used the machine to make fellow Squadron member [[Lady Lark]] obsessed with him. However, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand her irrational behavior, so went for a walk and was captured by the Institute. They tortured the Archer until he revealed the Squadron\xe2\x80\x99s new base of operations. They then kidnapped the Squadron\xe2\x80\x99s family members and attacked their headquarters. They began ambushing Squadron members and using the behavior modification machines on them as they returned from their missions. The Institute then brought the Squadron back to their lair where the Golden Archer and their captive family members were held. The Squadron attacked, revealing that Tom Thumb had designed the process not to work on Squadron members, and defeated the Institute completely.<ref>\'\'Squadron Supreme\'\' #5 (mini-series) (Jan. 1986)</ref>\n\nThe Institute of Evil\xe2\x80\x99s members were subjected to the Behavior Modification process, altering their personalities. The former super-criminals all became elected to full membership in the Squadron Supreme and aided them in their efforts to conquer the world in order to forcibly turn it into a [[utopia]].<ref>\'\'Squadron Supreme\'\' #6 (mini-series) (Feb. 1986)</ref>\n\nSome Institute members did not fare so well as members of the Squadron. Ape-X suffered from a psychotic withdrawal from reality and fell into a coma, due to her behavior modification process. After saving twenty factory workers from a gas leakage, Quagmire went into a coma. In the hospital, he was sucked into the hole in his brain that is a portal into the dimension from which his dark matter originates, and Doctor Decibel suffocated in Quagmire\xe2\x80\x99s extra-dimensional slime.<ref>\'\'Squadron Supreme\'\' #10 (mini-series) (June 1986)</ref>\n\nIn time, Squadron Supreme member [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Kyle Richmond (Earth-712)|Nighthawk]] objected to the extreme methods the Squadron was using to achieve its goals, and left the group. Nighthawk formed a rebel group, known as the America Redeemers, to oppose the Squadron\xe2\x80\x99s "benevolent" tyranny. The Redeemers included other enemies of the Squadron, expelled Squadron member the [[Golden Archer|Black Archer]], as well as unknown superheroes that infiltrated the Squadron to help take it down. With the help of [[Master Menace#Squadron Supreme|Master Menace]], the Redeemers were able to reverse the Behavior Modification of Foxfire, Lamprey, and the Shape and recruited them into his group. These three agents also remained in the Squadron as double agents.<ref>\'\'Squadron Supreme\'\' #11 (mini-series) (July 1986)</ref>\n\nWhen the Redeemers finally confronted the Squadron Supreme, an all-out battle broke out. Lamprey tried to absorb [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]]\xe2\x80\x99s power, but Doctor Spectrum was able to overload Lamprey\xe2\x80\x99s power which killed Lamprey. Foxfire, who had long been in love with Doctor Spectrum, tried to gain his approval by betraying Nighthawk, to allow the Squadron to win the fight. She used her powers to kill Nighthawk by blasting his heart and causing a massive coronary. Foxfire was then killed by fellow Redeemer [[Mink (comics)|Mink]], who had been in love with Nighthawk. The death of Nighthawk caused the Squadron members to realize that they had become the very thing that they had intended to oppose, and thus ended the fight.<ref>\'\'Squadron Supreme\'\' #12 (mini-series) (Aug. 1986)</ref>\n\nThe [[Shape (comics)|Shape]] was the only former member of the Institute of Evil that eventually chose to side with the Squadron Supreme, finding happiness in his new calling.<ref>\'\'Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe\'\' (graphic novel) (1989)</ref>\n\n==Members==\n* \'\'\'[[Ape-X]]\'\'\' - An intelligent ape who is a loose pastiche of [[Gorilla Grodd]].\n* \'\'\'[[Doctor Decibel]]\'\'\' - A criminal surgeon.\n* \'\'\'[[Foxfire (comics)|Foxfire]]\'\'\' - \n* \'\'\'[[Lamprey (comics)|Lamprey]]\'\'\' - A power-absorbing supervillain who is a pastiche of [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]].\n* \'\'\'[[Mink (comics)|Mink]]\'\'\' - A criminal who is a pastiche for [[Catwoman]].\n* \'\'\'[[Quagmire (comics)|Quagmire]]\'\'\' - \n* \'\'\'[[Shape (comics)|Shape]]\'\'\' - A supervillain who is loosely based on [[Plastic Man]].

A female counterpart of [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], she was created by [[Ed Brubaker]], [[Marko Djurdjevic]], and [[Clay Mann]], first appearing in \'\'[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]\'\' #111. She has primarily been an opponent of the superhero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].\n\nOriginally inspired to become a trained assassin when she witnessed [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] easily kill a number of people, she would later become a member of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]], although she did not hold their traditions in high esteem. Her alter ego is a lawyer, opposing Matt Murdock in the courtroom, thereby attacking Daredevil on two fronts. Lady Bullseye\'s true intentions were to take control of the Hand clan, but instead Daredevil becomes their leader.\n\n==Publication history==\nLady Bullseye was inspired by [[Lady Snowblood (manga)|Lady Snowblood]], a Japanese [[femme fatale]].<ref name="enterladybullseye">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.4804.Daredevil~colon~_Enter_Lady_Bullseye|title=Daredevil: Enter Lady Bullseye|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|date=2008-09-05 |publisher=Marvel.com|accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nBorn in [[Japan]], the young girl (it has not been revealed whether Maki Matsumoto is her birth name or an assumed one) who would become Lady Bullseye was imprisoned by the [[Yakuza]], who planned to sell her and many others into sexual slavery. However, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], on an unrelated errand, arrived to slaughter the mobsters. The sight of Bullseye effortlessly killing her captors inspired the girl to escape and become a killer.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #111</ref>\n\nYears later, now in the employ of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]], the famous ninja order, she arrives in New York, to take the lead in Hand ninja-lord Hiroshi\'s plan. However, she has demonstrated little tolerance for the Hand\'s ritual, interrupting some (who are used to those traditions) off-guard in order to kill her enemies. She kills and resurrects both [[White Tiger (Angela del Toro)|White Tiger]] and [[Black Tarantula]] to assist her.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #112-114</ref>\n\nAt the same time, it has been revealed that in her civilian guise she is a lawyer, targeting [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] by assisting the parents of Murdock\'s mentally-ill wife [[Milla Donovan]] in gaining custody of her. When one of her associates discovers this, she kills him to prevent the Hand from learning the truth. Hiroshi claims that all she has done has been according to his will. Lady Bullseye offers Daredevil the leadership of the Hand, which he refuses. The organization regroups to [[Spain]], preparing to initiate "Plan B". There, she finds [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], trying to live a normal civilian life, and killing his new girlfriend and her kids, and brutally stabbing Kingpin, telling him that this is a message for Matt Murdock.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #114-116</ref>\n\nIt turns out that Matsumoto\'s real goal was to take the leadership of the Hand herself, something she had been promised by Daredevil\'s ally [[Master Izo]], who was revealed to have trained her. However, Izo was lying, and instead intended for Daredevil himself to take that post and reform the Hand. This occurring, Daredevil had Lady Bullseye cast out of the Hand for being untrustworthy. Angry, she vowed to kill Izo.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #500</ref>\n\nLady Bullseye is shown to now be allied with the Kingpin against Daredevil, instigating a conflict between Daredevil and [[Norman Osborn]], which ultimately leads to Daredevil declaring Hell\'s Kitchen the territory of the Hand.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign - The List: Daredevil\'\' #1, \'\'Daredevil\'\' #501-504</ref>\n\nLady Bullseye was hired by an as yet unknown party to injure [[Pepper Potts]] with a compressed air rifle.<ref>\'\'Black Widow\'\' Vol. 4 #2</ref>\n\nDuring the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Lady Bullseye appears as a member of the Army of Evil and took part in the attack on Manhattan in retaliation for [[Avengers: Standoff!|what happened at Pleasant Hill]].<ref>\'\'Secret Empire\'\' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLady Bullseye has no apparent superhuman powers, but is a master of several martial arts and a proficient hand-to-hand combatant, and specializes in using both a katana and shuriken. It has been noted that she is faster than both Bullseye and the Kingpin. However, she is also less powerful. That did not stop her from defeating Daredevil and [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] on separate occasions, and nearly defeating Daredevil on another occasion. Daredevil has commented that in her costumed form she has little scent and a very level pulse, akin to one performing [[yoga]]. She is also skilled in legal matters, being a lawyer in her civilian guise.<ref>\'\'Daredevil #113\'\'</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Daredevil Noir===\nLady Bullseye appears as a caucasian woman called \'\'\'Eliza\'\'\'.

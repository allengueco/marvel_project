Besides being a [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]], he is immortal. He hides this from his fellow Deviants by pretending to be a long line of fathers/sons.{{issue|date=March 2013}} Also hidden from the Deviants is his long-standing (20,000 years) on-off relationship with [[Thena]], leader of the Eternals and mother of their twin children, [[Donald & Deborah Ritter]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn the past, Kro has disguised himself as the [[Devil]] in order to try to influence or frighten humans. His control over his own molecules renders him immune to the genetic manipulations of [[Ghaur]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nKro is also the founder of the [[Delta Network]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDespite his Deviant heritage, Kro possesses a number of superhuman traits characteristic of an Eternal. Kro maintains a virtually unbreakable mental control over the processes and structure of his body even when he is asleep or unconscious. As a result, Kro has a lifespan that has already lasted over 20,000 years and is immune to disease and aging. His mental control over his body enables him to maintain a youthful, vigorous physical condition. Kro is not as nearly indestructible as the Eternals. (For example, Ikaris nearly killed Kro once by strangulation.) But while sufficient force can kill Kro, he can use his mental control over his body to heal himself after being injured.\n\nKro also possesses the power of physical malleability, which is atypical for a Deviant. At will he can cause most of the tissue of his body to become pliant, enabling him to shape it mentally like putty into different configurations. Once the tissue is set in an altered form, Kro has only to stop concentrating and his body will retain that shape until such time as he concentrates upon changing it again. This ability enables him to disguise himself and take the appearance of others (with cosmetic help for skin color, body hair, and so forth). One of Kro\'s favorite ploys is to pass himself off among ordinary humanity as a demon by fashioning horns on his head.\n\nHowever, Kro\'s shape-changing powers are limited. He cannot alter the shape of his skeleton in more than minor ways. Moreover, he cannot eliminate any of his mass while transforming; he can only redistribute his 320 pounds of weight. Hence, he usually only uses his shape-changing power to alter his facial features. He can mentally mold the shape of his skull somewhat.\n\nKro has about three times the physical endurance of an ordinary human athlete. His heart is not located in the same place as an ordinary human being\'s; its true location is unrevealed.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\nThe Eternal #4 - #6 (2004)\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/brenni_au/K.html&date=2009-10-26+22:16:22  "K" in the Encyclopaedia Olympianna]\n*[http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/k/kro.htm Marvel Directory entry on Kro]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/19960101/http://www.worldfamouscomics.com/tony/back20050510.shtml The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics\' Creators]\n\n{{Eternals}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Deviants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

He is a prominent member of the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], a team of aliens who work for the titan [[Thanos]].\n\nEbony Maw appears as one of the Children of Thanos in the film \'\'[[Avengers: Infinity War]]\'\' (2018), where he is portrayed by [[Tom Vaughan-Lawlor]].\n\n==Publication history==\nEbony Maw first appears in a one panel cameo \'\'[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]\'\' #8 and was created by [[Jonathan Hickman]] and [[Mike Deodato]]. His second one panel appearance came later that month in \'\'[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]\'\' #1.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nEbony Maw was a member of [[Thanos]]\' [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]]. He is not a fighter, but a dangerous thinker of the Black Order. When Thanos targeted [[Earth]] as the next planet he would raze during the \'\'[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]\'\' storyline, Ebony Maw was dispatched to deal with [[Doctor Strange]].<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' Vol. 3 #8</ref>\n\nEbony Maw used his abilities to gain control over Doctor Strange and forced him to summon [[Shuma-Gorath]].<ref>\'\'Mighty Avengers\'\' Vol. 2 #2</ref> Then Ebony Maw used his abilities to have Doctor Strange serve as a double-agent for him when he reunited with the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]. When the Illuminati headed to numerous locations around the world to find Thanos\' son Thane, Doctor Strange found the boy in a hidden [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] city of Orollan (which is located in [[Greenland]]). Ebony remained in the location and forced Doctor Strange to forget about the discovery and to leave where he is now freed from Maw\'s control.<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' Vol. 3 #10</ref>\n\nWhen [[Black Bolt]] detonated a Terrigen Bomb which unleashed the Terrigen Mists upon the entire face of Earth, Thanos\' son Thane underwent Terrigenesis. The manifestation of his powers annihilated the entire town.<ref>\'\'Infinity\'\' #4</ref> Posing as an ally following the incident, Ebony Maw offered Thane a suit to control his powers, but also captured him in a containment field followed by Ebony Maw alerting Thanos to the location of his son.<ref>\'\'Infinity\'\' #5</ref> When the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] arrived in Orollan in order to defeat Thanos, Ebony Maw tested Thane by freeing him. Thane could escape or could fight Thanos and become what he had avoided his entire life. Thane agreed and embraced his true nature as the son of Thanos by fighting his father. Using the power of his right hand, Thane trapped Thanos and his ally [[Proxima Midnight]] in an amber construct which left them in a state of "living death." Upon the defeat of Thanos, Ebony Maw started disciplining Thane into becoming something greater than Thanos and greater than any one would.<ref>\'\'Infinity\'\' #6</ref>\n\nDuring the "No Surrender" arc, Ebony Maw appears as a member of [[Challenger (comics)|Challenger]]\'s Black Order where he pits them in a contest against [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]\'s [[Lethal Legion]].<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #681. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nEbony Maw has genius-level intellect. He mostly demonstrates his intelligence with his highly skilled abilities of manipulation being described as a "black tongue that spreads mischief and evil wherever he goes." Ebony Maw\xe2\x80\x99s skills at manipulation are a result of his superhumanly persuasive voice which allows him to control even the strongest minds such as Doctor Strange.\n\nHe also uses technology that specializes in teleportation and force field generation.\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\nEbony Maw appears in \'\'[[Avengers: Infinity War]]\'\', voiced and motion-captured by [[Tom Vaughan-Lawlor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/avengers-infinity-war-black-order-revealed/|title=The Minions of Thanos in \xe2\x80\x98Avengers: Infinity War\xe2\x80\x99 Have Been Revealed [D23 Expo 2017]|last=Hall|first=Jacob|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=July 15, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6rz7DWMoq|archivedate=July 15, 2017|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="Vaughan-Lawlor">{{cite web|url=http://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/tom-vaughan-lawlor-confirms-role-13506117|title=Tom Vaughan-Lawlor confirms role in Avengers: Infinity War|last=Arnold|first=Berry|publisher=DublinLive|date=August 21, 2017|accessdate=August 21, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6st6VQoE4?url=http://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/tom-vaughan-lawlor-confirms-role-13506117|archivedate=August 21, 2017|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="Vaughan-Lawlor2">{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/41387-infinity-war-ebony-maw-avengers-tom-vaughan-lawlor|title=This \'Infinity War\' Villain Is So Much More Than Thanos\' Henchman|last=Pante|first=Corey|publisher=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]|date=March 2, 2018|accessdate=March 6, 2018|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6xieoPu3W?url=https://www.inverse.com/article/41387-infinity-war-ebony-maw-avengers-tom-vaughan-lawlor|archivedate=March 6, 2018|deadurl=no|df=}}</ref> This version of the character has telekinetic powers and acts as Thanos\' herald, characterized by a speech to "hear and rejoice" about Thanos\' intentions he recites whenever they arrive at a location. Upon arriving on New York with [[Black Dwarf (comics)#Film|Cull Obsidian]], Maw battles with the Avengers and manages to overpower and capture [[Doctor Strange]] to retrieve the [[Infinity Gems#Film|Time Stone]] from him. While Cull is defeated, Maw leaves with Strange taking him aboard the Q-ship and tortures him in an attempt to have him give up the stone. However [[Tony Stark]] and [[Peter Parker]], who snuck aboard the ship, come to rescue Strange. After a brief confrontation, the two distract Maw and blast a hole on the side of the ship, causing an [[explosive decompression]] that blows Maw outside, leaving him to die in the vacuum of space.\n\n===Television===\n* Ebony Maw appears in \'\'[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]\'\' voiced by [[Ren\xc3\xa9 Auberjonois]].<ref name="Voice">{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Marvel-Universe/Ebony-Maw/|title=Voice of Ebony Maw|website=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}</ref> He appears as a member of the Black Order.\n* Ebony Maw appears in \'\'[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]\'\' voiced by [[James Urbaniak]].<ref name="Voice"/> While initially a member of the Black Order, he later joins the Universal Believers in Volume Two.\n\n===Video games===\n* Ebony Maw appears as a playable character in \'\'[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/avengers-infinity-war-black-order-guide/|first=Anthony|last=Couto|title=Avengers: Infinity War: Thanos\xe2\x80\x99 Black Order, Explained|date=July 16, 2017|accessdate=April 28, 2017|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6st6VQoE4?url=https://www.cbr.com/avengers-infinity-war-black-order-guide/|archivedate=April 28, 2018|deadurl=no}}</ref>\n* Ebony Maw appears as a playable character in \'\'[[Marvel: Future Fight]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmicbooknews.com/content/marvel-future-fight-thanos-black-order-trailer#axzz4qyRPiqEF|title=MARVEL FUTURE FIGHT THANOS\' BLACK ORDER TRAILER|author=Staff|website=Cosmic Book News|date=March 21, 2016|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}</ref>\n* Ebony Maw appears as a playable character in \'\'[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]\'\'.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/games/news/939179-lego-marvel-super-heroes-2-gets-infinity-war-dlc|title=Avengers: Infinity War DLC lets you play as Thanos in Lego Marvel|last=|first=|date=|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-04-28}}</ref> He appears in the "Infinity War" DLC.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Ebony_Maw_%28Earth-616%29 Ebony Maw] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/ebony-maw/4005-90606/ Ebony Maw] at Comic Vine\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=71612|title=Ebony Maw}}\n\n{{Thanos}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Jonathan Hickman]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2013]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional hypnotists and indoctrinators]]\n[[Category:Fictional telekinetics]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]'

The character is usually depicted as an enemy of the [[X-Men]], in particular [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]. Created by [[Jim Lee]] and [[Whilce Portacio]], he first appeared in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' #281 (October 1991).\n\nFitzroy hails from the same [[dystopia]]n future as Bishop. A mutant criminal, he possesses the ability to absorb energy from human beings and use that energy to open [[time travel|time portals]], which is how Bishop traveled to the present. He has since been featured as the main adversary in the series featuring Bishop.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===The future===\nTrevor Fitzroy was the illegitimate son of Anthony Shaw, Black King of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], in a dystopian future. Fitzroy joined the \'\'\'Academy for [[Xavier\'s Security Enforcers]]\'\'\' (XSE) and had a relationship with [[Shard (comics)|Shard]]. He turned out to be a criminal, though, and was removed from the Academy. His wealthy father tried to protect his son for a while, but when Fitzroy was caught for murder, even he could no longer protect him. Fitzroy was captured and arrested by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], Shard\'s brother and an XSE officer.\n\nFitzroy himself thought that he was merely a teleporter, but a secret group of XSE agents, known as the \'\'\'Xavier\'s Underground Enforcers\'\'\' (XUE) discovered that Fitzroy had the ability to travel through time. The XUE recruited Shard and freed Fitzroy, hoping to use his powers to change the past to create a better present.  However, Shard, reminded how dangreous Fitzroy was, stopped them and Fitzroy was returned to prison.\n\n===The Upstarts===\nFrom prison, Fitzroy escaped to the present time with his mutant minion [[Bantam (comics)|Bantam]]. There, he became involved with a group known as the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]], a competition set up by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] to eliminate her rivals within the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Led by the Gamesmaster, the Upstarts had to kill other mutants to receive points. The Upstart with the most points would win the prize: control over the Hellfire Club and the other competitors. To enter the competition, one had to kill a member of the Hellfire Club\'s Inner Circle (though later members didn\'t have to.) \nAs part of this "game," Fitzroy unleashed [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] on the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] and their leader [[Donald Pierce]]. All were killed except Pierce, who escaped and arrived at the Hellfire Club, followed by the Sentinels. The Sentinels killed Pierce (later rebuilt) and then killed most of the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]], put their leader, [[Emma Frost]], into a coma and apparently killed Jean Grey (who had actually switched her mind with Frost). The [[X-Men]], who had been negotiating with Frost, fought Fitzroy. Fitzroy was forced to open a large time portal, allowing prisoners from his own time to escape to the present. The prisoners attacked the X-Men, but stopped when three figures stepped through the portal: Bishop and fellow XSE agents Randall and Malcolm. They went after Fitzroy, eventually killing the escaped criminals. However, Malcolm and Randall were killed, and Bishop remained in the present, joining the X-Men.\n\nFitzroy turned on Selene and captured her, though she later managed to escape. He also brought in [[Siena Blaze]] to compete in the Upstart competition. Fitzroy clashed with the X-Men a second time when he tried to kill [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], but managed to escape again. When the Gamesmaster declared that the new target for the Upstart competition would be former members of the [[New Mutants]] and Hellions, Fitzroy attacked [[X-Force]], demanding they turn over [[Rictor]] and [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]. In the ensuing confrontation, X-Force leader [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] tricked Fitzroy by disguising his techno-organic arm as wholly organic; when Fitzroy tried to absorb his life energy through the arm, his powers backfired and instead used his own life energy to open a portal, seemingly killing him.\n\n===After the Upstarts===\nHow he survived is left unknown, but Fitzroy eventually reappeared under the thrall of Selene as the White Rook of the Hellfire Club. During this time he cooperates with Pierce and Shaw, despite his previous attempts to kill them. He leaves the Club and travels back to an alternate future (Earth-9910), now calling himself the \'\'\'Chronomancer\'\'\'. He takes control over this new timeline, but Bishop arrives and fights Fitzroy, eventually killing him.{{issue|date=September 2011}}\n\n===X-Factor===\nA younger version appears that is a participant in the Summers Rebellion. Here, he is shown to be a good guy. After Cortex kills him during a fight, [[Layla Miller]] resurrects him physically but is unable to revive him with a soul, establishing the point at which he becomes a villain.<ref>X-Factor\' vol.3 #46</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nFitzroy possessed the mutant ability to fatally drain the life force of living beings by physical contact. With these energies, Fitzroy could create portals that could teleport those passing through them across time and space, yet, the portals are one way, trying to pass through the wrong way results in the traveler having his body terribly misshapen. He often was dependent on the mutant Bantam to direct and catalog the time-portals he made and confirm when they should expire, lacking the ability to do so himself.\n\nFitzroy also can use the converted life force he drains to infuse on the dead that essentially resurrect them, however due to his nature, its an ability he rarely uses.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men Annual\'\' (1st series) #17</ref>\n\nIn his early appearances, Fitzroy wears a futuristic battle-armor that increases his strength and protects him from opponents. This battle armor was destroyed by the X-Men and a second suit of armor was destroyed by X-Force.\n\nFitzroy also had several [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] that obeyed his commands. These Sentinels were smaller than the 20th century type, but had the ability to repair themselves using material from their near vicinity.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===X-Men \'92===\nFitzroy appears in the second volume of \'\'[[X-Men \'92]]\'\'. As in his original incarnation, he is a member of the Upstarts and hails from Bishop\'s future timeline. Curiously, his manservant Bantam does not appear, nor is any mention made of him. After the threat of \'\'\'Alpha Red\'\'\' (a progenitor of [[Omega Red]] released by fellow Upstarts Andrea and Andreas Strucker) is defeated, he and [[Shinobi Shaw]] go on an extended pleasure cruise, only to enlisted into a confederation of villains led by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] to stand against the title\'s main villain \'\'\'X-odus the Forgotten [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]\'\'\'. Fitzroy last appears alongside his fellow Upstarts, being humorously threatened by X-Force member [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] for their role in earlier events.<ref>\'\'X-Men \'92 Vol 2 Issues 1-10</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n[[Image:Trevor Fitzroy & Bantam.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Trever Fitzroy and Bantam from [[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men Animated Series]]]]\nFitzroy was a guest-star in the two-part episode "One Man\'s Worth" of the episodes of the mid-\'90s [[X-Men (TV series)|\'\'X-Men\'\' animated series]]. Fitzroy, known as "the Mutant Traitor", under the orders of [[Master Mold]], travels back in time to 1959 to murder Charles Xavier, creating an alternate "[[Days of Future Past]]" future in which the Sentinels rule and the mutant rebellion never occurred. He turns against Master Mold after his future-self reveals that Master Mold betrays him. In the cartoon, he does not kill those whose energy he absorbs, but knocks them unconscious for a few days.\n\n===Video games===\n* Fitzroy was one of the bosses in \'\'[[X-Men: Gamesmaster\'s Legacy]]\'\'.  Defeating him allows [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] to be a playable character.\n* He also appears as the final boss of \'\'[[Wolverine: Adamantium Rage]]\'\' for the [[Sega Genesis]].\n\n===Other Appearances===\n* An [[action figure]] of Trevor Fitzroy was produced by [[Toy Biz]] in 1994 as part of the fourth X-Men wave. He was packaged with 4 pieces of snap-on crystal battle armor.\n* Trevor Fitzroy is a playing piece in the Heroclix game system. He has the \'\'Future\'\' and \'\'\'Hellfire Club\'\'\' keywords, and is played at 65pts.<ref>HCRealms</ref><ref>Wizkids / NECA</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://marvel.wikia.com/Trevor_Fitzroy_(Earth-1191) Fitzroy\'s article on Marvel Comics Database]\n*[http://marvel.com/universe/Trevor_Fitzroy Trevor Fitzroy\'s article on Marvel.com]\n\n{{X-Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fitzroy, Trevor}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jim Lee]]'

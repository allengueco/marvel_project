An exploding lab experiment bombards Gemma with radiation, causing her future child to be born a mutant. Nekra is born with fangs and white skin, but is not an [[Albinism|albino]]. Loathed by her parents and community, Nekra runs away into the New Mexico desert to live alone when she is fourteen years old.\n\nShe soon encounters by chance another child who has been mutated by the same explosion. Although his parents were white, he had been born dark-skinned and had developed fur and [[baboon]]-like features, for which he had named himself [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]]. For six years they live by theft and scavenging, until they are attacked by a lynch mob that thought they were monsters. While filled with rage, Nekra discovers she is invulnerable to the mob\'s attacks. Slaying a few of their persecutors, the two escape and come to regard each other as if they were siblings.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe two later leave to Africa, as part of the Mandrill\'s ambitious scheme to overthrow multiple nations through [[Black Spectre]], a [[cult of personality]] powered by the Mandrill\'s pheromonal control over women. This effort is thwarted by [[Shanna the She-Devil]]. The two eventually escape, kidnapping Shanna\'s father in the process, and eventually killing him.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nTheir next plot is of similar means, whereby they use the Mandrill\'s powers to raise a cult of black women to overthrow America. They are eventually defeated on the [[White House]] lawn by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], and Shanna. Abandoned by Mandrill, Nekra is captured by authorities.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nNekra is held captive and drugged in a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] hospital, until a subliminal message from [[Hate-Monger]] inadvertently gave her the rage necessary to break free. While in the New York sewers, Nekra encounters a cult of [[Kali]], whom she persuades that Nekra herself was the reincarnation of Kali. She then moves to the West Coast where she kills and replaces Adrienne Hatros, the reclusive sponsor of an emotional research clinic where Nekra hopes to overcome her own dependency upon emotions. There she develops a drug to subdue feelings of affection, and successfully field-tests it using [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] as the target of her feelings.<ref>\'\'Spider-Woman\'\' #16.</ref>\n\nNekra falls in with the voodoo-master [[Black Talon (comics)|the Black Talon]] as voodoo tutor, and with [[Grim Reaper (comics)|the Grim Reaper]] as her lover. When the Grim Reaper dies in combat, Nekra is able to briefly reanimate him as a [[zombie]], so lifelike that even the Grim Reaper does not realize he is dead. When Nekra\'s love becomes greater than her hate though, the Reaper dies again. Nekra takes his corpse with her, in hopes of reanimating him again.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nNekra then had run-ins with [[Spider-Man]], and then [[Henry Pym]].

First she seduces Dr Druid, which negates his powers, but he manages to regain them via sacrifice. Nekra then shoots Dr. Druid in the forehead, killing him.<ref>\'\'Druid\'\' #2-4</ref>\n\nNekra is one of a handful of mutants to have retained her powers in the wake of [[House of M]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nNekra resurfaces and is seen donating genetic material to an M.G.H ring that had sprung up in L.A. after the death of [[Pride (comics)|The Pride]].<ref>\'\'Loners\'\' #1</ref> She is defeated by [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]], [[Darkhawk]], and the third [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Spider-Woman]].

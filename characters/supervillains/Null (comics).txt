Null is a [[List of Marvel Comics demons|demon]] and enemy of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] and the [[Squadron Supreme]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand-section|date=January 2016}}\nNull first appeared in \'\'[[The Defenders (comic book)|Defenders]]\'\' #103 (January 1982) and was created by [[J. M. DeMatteis|J.M. DeMatteis]] and [[Don Perlin]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nNull was spawned by the desires for revenge on the cosmos that lay in the collective unconscious of the S\'raphh, a now extinct race of winged humanoids that once lived on Earth\'s moon. Null is a nihilist and destroyer.\n\nNull first became known to humans when it terrorized the town of Christianboro. There, it battled and was defeated by the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #103</ref>\n\nNull next possessed Adam Henderson, and battled the original [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]].<ref>\'\'Ghost Rider\'\' Vol. 2 #71</ref>\n\nBehind the scenes, Null enabled the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]] to take over the United States of [[Earth-712|Earth-S]] and defeat the [[Squadron Supreme]]. Alongside the Over-Mind, Null battled the Defenders and the Squadron,<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #112-113</ref> and then drained the Over-Mind\'s psychic powers. However, when the good of the S\'raphh race was reawakened, Null ceased to exist and was seemingly destroyed.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #114</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nNull is a mystic life-form created over the ages from the collective unconscious of the 500,000 members of the extinct S\'Raphh race, and as such has an almost unlimited ability to manipulate the forces of magic. Null normally has no corporeal form, and usually takes the form of a multi-eyed, multi-tentacled cloud of an unknown purple gaseous substance. Its intelligence is immeasurable, and it has incredible stamina and durability. Null has the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a wide variety of effects, including physical malleability, intangibility, levitation, inter-dimensional teleportation, restoration of spirits to the physical plane, reanimation and control of corpses, possession of the bodies of physical beings, telepathy, illusion-casting, and the ability to project powerful psychokinetic concussion blasts.\n\nNull is vulnerable to the mystic energies controlled by certain beings, such as the [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Isaac Christians)|Gargoyle]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\n==In other media==\nNull appears in the \'\'[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]\'\' episode "Fear Itself", voiced by [[John DiMaggio]].{{cn|date=March 2017}} In the series, Null is an entity that thrives on fear and uses his victim\'s phobias to manifest a physical form before attacking the nearest planet. While on the path back to Earth, the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. find [[Silver Surfer]] fighting Null until he is knocked out. Null uses its powers to bring the fears of the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. to life: using [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]\'s fear of losing control in the form of Dark Hulk, [[Rick Jones (comics)|A-Bomb]]\'s fear of clowns in the form of [[Obnoxio the Clown]], [[She-Hulk]]\'s fear of the cold by slowly encasing her in ice, [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]]\'s fear of losing his strength by rendering him weak and extremely scrawny and Skaar\'s fear of robots by manifesting robots. Null also brought [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]\'s fear of losing his intelligence to life by shrinking his large head until he is reduced to a babbling idiot. When Silver Surfer regains consciousness, he helps the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. fight Null after gaining physical form with plans to invade Earth through a wormhold and feed on the fear of its inhabitants. After the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. defeat Null, forcing the entity to become non-corporeal and powerless, Silver Surfer closes the wormhole from the other side as he vows to the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. that he will tell Earth about their heroic actions in their fight against Null.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/nullthelivingdarkness.htm|Null}}\n\n{{Defenders}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Null (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by J.

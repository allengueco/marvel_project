In 1459, while leading a Turkish army to conquer Transylvania, he found Dracula, who had been wounded in battle.  Turac took Dracula to a gypsy woman named [[Lianda]] to be healed.  Lianda was actually a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] and turned Dracula into a vampire as well.  Dracula awoke to find himself Turac\'s prisoner, unaware of the transformation he had gone through.  Turac had raped Dracula\'s wife Maria, who died while trying to flee Turac.

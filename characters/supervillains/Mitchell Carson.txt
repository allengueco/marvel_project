He was the primary antagonist in the 2006 \'\'[[Eric O\'Grady|Irredeemable Ant-Man]]\'\' series.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nMitch Carson was a high-ranked [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] security agent. He had killed his father when he was fifteen years old and many others after that. He had, however, never been caught for any of those crimes and managed to find employment with S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name="Irredeemable Ant-Man #11">\'\'Irredeemable Ant-Man\'\' #11</ref>\n\nCarson was part of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team that took the [[Alternative versions of Iron Man#Iron Maniac|Iron Maniac]] into custody. The alternate Stark was held alongside the [[Life Model Decoy]] (LMD) of [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]].<ref>\'\'Marvel Team-Up\'\' Vol. 3 #21</ref> His body somehow adapted to the sedatives used, and he attacked the agents watching him, then activated the LMD coercing it to help.<ref>\'\'Marvel Team-Up\'\' Vol. 3 #22</ref>\n\nCarson was supposed to become the wearer of the newest [[Ant-Man]] suit made for S.H.I.E.L.D. by [[Hank Pym]]. The suit was thought to be stolen, but it actually disappeared by accident when Agent Chris McCarthy tried it on. Chris was later killed during a Hydra attack on the Helicarrier, and it was then that [[Eric O\'Grady]] took the suit for himself.<ref>\'\'Irredeemable Ant-Man\'\' #3</ref>\n\nCarson was determined to find the suit and bring in whoever stole it.<ref>\'\'Irredeemable Ant-Man\'\' #4</ref> During his mission to capture the new Ant-Man, he was heavily burned in the face during a fight with him. After that, it did not take long for Carson to find out that the new Ant-Man was actually O\'Grady.<ref>\'\'Irredeemable Ant-Man\'\' #5</ref>\n\nEventually, Carson used an older Ant-Man suit and managed to confront and capture O\'Grady. Instead of bringing him to justice, however, Carson planned to torture him.<ref>\'\'Irredeemable Ant-Man\'\' #10</ref> Carson confessed his crimes but before he could kill O\'Grady, [[Iron Man]] arrived and intervened. Seeing Carson in the Ant-Man suit while torturing O\'Grady, Stark fought and defeated him. O\'Grady lied to Stark and told him that Carson killed McCarthy and tried to steal the suit. O\'Grady claimed to be on the run from Carson and trying to prevent him from getting the suit. Carson was arrested for attempted murder and stealing the Ant-Man suit.<ref name="Irredeemable Ant-Man #11"/>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCarson has S.H.I.E.L.D. training, specifically in firearms/explosives, [[espionage]], intelligence gathering, and hand-to-hand combat.\n\nHe gained access to an old Ant-Man suit and used it to shrink and take out Eric O\'Grady wearing more advanced G.I.Ant-Man suit.\n\n==In other media==\n[[File:Martin Donovan as Mitchell Carson.png|right|thumb|[[Martin Donovan]] as Mitchell Carson in the 2015 film \'\'[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]\'\'.]]\n[[Martin Donovan]] portrays Mitchell Carson in the 2015 film \'\'[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]\'\'.

Decades later, Carson is allied with Pym\'s former protege-turned-adversary, [[Darren Cross]], who has managed to replicate the Pym particles. During a confrontation among these parties in the film\'s final Act, Carson absconds with the particles.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Mitchell_Carson_%28Earth-616%29 Mitchell Carson] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Henry Pym}}\n{{Nick Fury}}\n{{S.H.I.E.L.D.}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carson, Mitchell}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can change size]]\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D. agents]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]'

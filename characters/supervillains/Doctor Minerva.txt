As they escape, Minerva is attacked by [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]] and the fight also draws [[Spider-Man]]\'s attention. As the two superheroes work together to fight her, Minerva reveals her plan of using the genetic material from Terrigenesis cocoons to create a new breed of Kree Super-Soldiers and shows the early results of her work by transforming into a giant creature to attack the heroes.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' Vol. 3 #7</ref> During this time, she used the villain [[Clash (comics)|Clash]] and some unnamed people as her hired henchmen.

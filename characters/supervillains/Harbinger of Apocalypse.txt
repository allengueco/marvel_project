[[Cable (comics)|Cable]] tried to stop the Hellfire Club, but he was too late and the Harbinger awoke.  The Harbinger defeated the Hellfire Club and disappeared, but Cable tracked him down.  The Harbinger told Cable that his programming dictated that he should bring destruction and chaos to the world, but he wanted to judge humanity himself before obeying.{{issue|date=May 2013}}\n\nSome time later, the Harbinger reappeared in [[Manhattan]] and decided that humanity should be destroyed.  Cable and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] battled the Harbinger, but he adapted to all of their attacks.

The bomb exploded over the [[Atlantic Ocean]], killing the Harbinger, but Cable was saved by a group of time travellers.{{issue|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Harbinger had the ability to adapt to any attack used against him.

An extremely large woman, her [[obesity]] enables her to have above-average strength and durability. Her plan was to use a bomb to murder the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] and the [[President of the United States]]. However, [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] and [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]] of [[Alpha Flight]] discovered her plans and eventually confronted the woman.<ref>\'\'Alpha Flight\'\' #22</ref>\n\nDuring a battle, Pearl was accidentally stabbed in the chest by one of her own allies, a thin-man named Bones.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/pinkpearlaf.htm marvunapp.com]</ref> Due to her fat, she was able to survive the encounter, and later joined the villainess [[Superia]] on her cruise ship for female criminals. As a member of the [[Femizons]], Pink Pearl went head-to-head with [[Captain America]] and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #387-392</ref> After the group\'s disbandment, Pink Pearl established herself as a business woman and opened a male [[strip club]] called "Cloisters." Unfortunately for her, Aurora, [[Vindicator (comics)|Guardian]], and [[Diamond Lil (comics)|Diamond Lil]] were all patrons, and started a brawl.<ref>\'\'Alpha Flight\'\' #105</ref> Pink Pearl eventually got the trio of women arrested,{{issue|date=January 2013}} and presumably still runs Cloisters. Pink Pearl speaks in [[Grammatical person|third-person]], and though comes across as being quite inadequate, she is quite intelligent and a formidable adversary.\n\nPink Pearl later appeared as a member of the [[Shadow Council]]\'s incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>\'\'Secret Avengers\'\' #29</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nHer great weight gives above-average strength and durability.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Pearl_Gross_%28Earth-616%29 Pink Pearl] at Marvel Wiki\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/pinkpearlaf.htm|Pink Pearl}}\n* [http://www.alphaflight.net/alphanex/index.php?title=Pink_Pearl Pink Pearl] on Alphanex Entry at AlphaFlight.Net \n\n{{Flight Program}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1985]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional Canadian people]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}'

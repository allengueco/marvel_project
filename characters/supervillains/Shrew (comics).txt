Tiring of this existence, perhaps after being arrested, she turned in evidence against her old allies in exchange for being given immunity from criminal trial.

While X-Factor was occupied against her former teammates, Shrew was left to face [[Tremolo (comics)|Tremolo]].{{Issue|date=September 2011}}\n\nX-Factor managed to temporarily drive off Hell's Belles, but Cyber had poisoned Strong Guy and demanded Shrew in exchange for an antidote. The US government's toxicologist provided his own antidote, and X-Factor and the Shrew confronted Cyber and the Belles. X-Factor joined by [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] overpowered their attackers, and Shrew herself gathered the courage to knock Cyber into the path of an oncoming subway train.{{Issue|date=September 2011}}\n\nIt is unknown if Shrew lost or kept her mutant powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMarilyn can transform into a large anthropomorphic [[soricidae]].

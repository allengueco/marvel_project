He was the first character from the ad campaign to enter mainstream Marvel continuity. The Icemaster Hostess ad appeared in multiple comics which debuted on the newsstands in December 1979. Like the rest of the Hostess advertisement characters, the Icemaster then languished in anonymity for over a decade, until writer [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Mark Bagley]] included a contest for the comic book \'\'[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]\'\'. He introduced a new rendition of the [[Masters of Evil]] which was populated by obscure characters. To win the contest, contestants had to supply the names and debuts of each of the 25 villains shown on a [[Comics vocabulary#Splash page|splash page]]. Icemaster was easily the most obscure of the lot.\n\nThe [[Avengers Academy]] entry of "Avengers Roll Call" revealed that Icemaster\'s real name is Bradley Kroon.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAlthough how he gained his powers and abilities are unknown, Bradley Kroon had plans to create the next ice age as the Icemaster. He had frozen much of New York until he encountered the [[Human Torch]]. The Human Torch defeated him by throwing Hostess Fruit Pies to him, inducing his surrender.<ref>\'\'Hostess Pie Advertisement\'\' in \'\'Avengers #191\'\'</ref>\n\nIcemaster later appeared as a member of [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]]\'s [[Masters of Evil]]. In the story\'s plot, Icemaster is defeated when Hawkeye tricks Scorcher into accidentally blasting him. Before that, Icemaster accidentally hits [[Man-Killer]], one of his own teammates, with an ice blast.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\'#25</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\'\' storyline, Icemaster is among the supervillains that escape from Raft after what [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] in the form of Kurrth: Breaker of Stone did to it.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #158</ref> Icemaster was seen with [[Living Laser]], [[Bastards of Evil]] members Aftershock and Ember, and [[Whirlwind]] in Stamford. When [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]] attacked them, the villains managed to defeat Speedball. Upon leaving Stamford, Living Laser ridiculed Icemaster for eating too many fruit pies.<ref>\'\'Fear Itself: The Home Front\'\' #2</ref>\n\nIcemaster, Aftershock, and Ember faced off against [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]], [[Vance Astrovik]], [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]], and the students of [[Avengers Academy]] when Jeremy Briggs knocked them out. Jeremy even used his powers to melt Icemaster\'s ice revealing his true form.<ref>\'\'Avengers Academy\'\' #20</ref>\n\nIcemaster was transferred to a prison in upstate New York. He alongside [[Ruby Thursday]], [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], [[Schizoid Man (comics)|Schizoid Man]], [[Quicksand (comics)|Quicksand]], [[Silk Fever]], Supercharger, and [[Lightmaster]] staged a prison break only to be defeated by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]].<ref>\'\'X-Men Legacy\'\' #275</ref>\n\nIcemaster was later transferred to Pace Federal Penitentiary and was among the 100,000 prisoners taking Borya Chic\'s offer to kill [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] (who had broken into Pace Federal Penitentiary) for $1,000,000.00 or $1,000.00 for aiding in his death. Icemaster froze Gambit only to break free of the ice just as [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]] and the [[Uncanny Avengers|Avengers Unity Squad]] arrive to defeat the prisoners.<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' Vol. 5 #17</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nIcemaster can generate and control ice. He can create blasts of cold, ice missiles and walls of ice from ambient moisture, as well as forming sleet, snow, and freezing rain. Icemaster is also shown to reshape his hands into various weapons like maces.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://marvel.com/universe/Icemaster Icemaster] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Bradley_Kroon_(Earth-616) Icemaster] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/icemaster/4005-42848/ Icemaster] at Comic Vine\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/icmstr.htm|Icemaster}}\n\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1979]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with ice or cold abilities]]'

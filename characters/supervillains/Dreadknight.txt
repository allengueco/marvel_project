Upon learning of Velsing\'s treacherous ideals, Doom uses a bio-fusion device to graft a skull-like cybernetic helmet to Velsing\'s head, scarring him as a way to make him even with Doom. Velsing flees and comes under the care of Victoria Frankenstein, who nurses him back to health at Castle Frankenstein. The character gains a variety of weapons and rides the "Hellhorse", a mutated bat-winged flying horse genetically engineered from [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]]\'s flying horse by Victoria Frankenstein. Calling himself the Dreadknight, the character attempts to force more resources from Frankenstein to defeat Doctor Doom, only to be defeated by [[Iron Man]], [[Frankenstein\'s Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein\'s Monster]], and Victoria\'s mutated charges The Children.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #101-102</ref>\n\nDreadknight is revived by the mystical villains [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] and [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]] and menaced [[Captain Britain]], [[Victoria Bentley]], and [[Bloodwraith|Sean Dolan]], but is defeated by [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref>\'\'Black Knight\'\' vol. 2 #2</ref>\n\nDreadknight appeared as a member of [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]\'s latest incarnation of the [[Frightful Four]] alongside [[Trapster]] and [[Man-Bull]]. In their attempt to capture a physicist named Dr. Cargill, the Frightful Four were defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and Dr. Cargill\'s daughter Turbine.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man: Chaos in Calgary\'\' #3</ref>\n\nDreadknight was among the villains that attended the wedding of [[Absorbing Man]] and [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]]. He fled when [[She-Hulk]] crashed the wedding.<ref>\'\'Avengers Unplugged\'\' #4</ref>\n\n[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] impersonated Dreadknight in order to get close to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #20</ref>\n\nFollowing Doctor Doom\'s apparent death at the hands of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], Dreadknight briefly takes over Latveria and battles Spider-Man where he is defeated by him.<ref>\'\'Spider-Man Unlimited\'\' #16</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\'\' storyline, [[Quasimodo (comics)|Quasimodo]] researched Dreadknight amongst other villains for [[Norman Osborn]]. When researching Dreadknight, Quasimodo considered him to be a poor pitiful creature.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign Files\'\' #1</ref>\n\nDreadknight later appeared fighting [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and apparently still serving (but resenting) [[Doctor Doom]]. Iron Man defeated Dreadknight while the Hellhorse flew off without him.<ref>\'\'Iron Man: Legacy\'\' #3</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDreadknight wears a steel alloy body armor granting him superhuman strength and durability. The character uses a power lance capable of projecting energy blasts; electrified steel cable bolas; miniature missiles; and also uses a carbon dioxide pistol that fires concentrated nerve gas which can render opponents unconscious or kill them. Bram Velsing is also a gifted scientist with skills as an engineer.\n\nDreadknight rides the "Hellhorse", a mutated flying horse with sharp teeth, a razor-barbed mane, bat-like wings, talons, and a dragon-like tail. It was genetically engineered by Victoria Frankenstein from the winged horse that was used by [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]], the villainous version of the [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]].\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Bram Velsing appears in a suit of armor based on [[Ultimate Iron Man (character)|Iron Man]]\'s designs. His armor features a skull motif and is painted in a color scheme reminiscent of his mainstream Marvel Universe counterpart. The German-born Velsing made his home in a renovated Castle [[Frankenstein]] where he fought Iron Man. At the end of their encounter, Iron Man locked down the defeated Velsing\'s armor leaving him to [[Asphyxia|suffocate]]. At one point during the battle, Velsing asks why a girl like [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Justine Hammer]] is in his presence "without a leash".<ref>\'\'Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars\'\' #2-3</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Dreadknight appeared in the 1990s \'\'[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]\'\' TV series, voiced by [[Neil Dickson]]. He serves as one of the minions of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]. Dreadknight and [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]] were rivals for the affections of [[Hypnotia]] (the sole female member of the Mandarin\'s followers). In this incarnation his Hellhorse is named Nightwing. \n* The Dreadknights appear in \'\'[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]\'\'. In the episode "Ancient History 101", they are a legion of stone statues brought to life by a test formed by the first Mandarin detailing about the Test of Wisdom. The word to stop them and pass the test is [[Carl Jung|Jung]] (which Iron Man managed to translate off of a sword that belonged to one of the Dreadknights).\n\n===Toys===\n* [[Toy Biz]] produced a Dreadknight action figure for the 1994 Iron Man Animated Series.\n* A figure of Dreadknight was released in \'\'The Danger of Dreadknight\'\' 4-pack from the \'\'[[Marvel Super Hero Squad]]\'\' line, packaged with 2 figures of Iron Man and one of [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]].\n* Dreadknight is also included in the San Diego Comic Con exclusive Marvel Legends "The Raft" box set.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Dreadknight Dreadknight] at Marvel.com\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix7/dreadknight.htm Dreadknight] at Marvel Appendix\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/d/dreadknight.htm Dreadknight at MarvelDirectory.com]\n\n{{Iron Man}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Mantlo]]\n[[Category:Characters created by George Tuska]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\n[[Category:Fictional engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Latverians]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

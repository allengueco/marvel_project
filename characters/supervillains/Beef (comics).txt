The character is usually depicted as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] from the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]] group created as the [[antithesis]] to the [[X-Men]]\'s junior team of mutants, the [[New Mutants]].\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nBeef is recruited to the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]\'s junior team of mutants by the villainous [[Emma Frost|White Queen]]. After suffering the loss of the [[Warpath (comics)|second Thunderbird]] due to morality issues, Beef is picked up as the Hellions new powerhouse. His first mission, and the only one he appears as part of, requires the Hellions to fight the [[New Warriors]] to vie for the membership of [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]]. During the initial stages of the fight, which takes place in the Warriors\' [[penthouse apartment|penthouse]] home, Beef is fully willing to kill [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]] and [[Tai (comics)|Tai]], though the latter was most likely immune to any efforts he would have made. Beef fell short of the mark placed on him when he is beaten by the New Warrior member [[Namorita]].<ref>\'\'New Warriors\'\' (1st series) #9</ref>\n\nSoon after, Emma throws a party at another penthouse location which the Hellions, as well as the [[X-Men]] Gold team, attend. It was there that [[Trevor Fitzroy]]\xe2\x80\x94a member of the villainous group known as the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]]\xe2\x80\x94crashes the party with the goal of killing Emma. This would gain Fitzroy valued points within the group. The Hellions are mere formalities: Beef was killed in the initial onslaught, sent crashing through the window to die on the streets below. The rest of his teammates are drained of their life energies in order to fuel Fitzroy\'s [[Teleportation|teleportation portal]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #281-282 (1991)</ref>\n\nBeef makes a [[postmortem]] appearance; however, this was just a trick played by the [[Demons in the Marvel Universe|demon]] [[D\'Spayre]] to agitate Emma Frost.<ref>\'\'Generation X\'\' Annual 1997</ref>\n\n===Necrosha===\nBeef, along with all the other deceased Hellions is resurrected by Selene and Eli Bard. After breaking into Utopia with the help of Cypher, he and the other Hellions confront Emma Frost and taunt her for not saving them.<ref>\'\'X-Necrosha\'\' #1</ref> Unlike most "zombies" of old, Beef and the rest of  his teammates, even though they are aware that they are technically "dead", retain the whole of their personalities with Beef acting as brash and dim-witted as he was when he was "alive" while still carrying out Selene\'s orders.<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' #8-9 (2009)</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nBeef\'s abilities include super strength and stamina.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\'\'All-New Official Handbook Of The Marvel Universe A To Z 05 (2006): Hellions\'\'.\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/characters/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=218 Uncannyxmen.net character bio on Beef]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060623115054/http://uncannyxmen.net/db/pov/showquestion.asp?faq=5&fldAuto=24 Uncannyxmen.net feature on the Hellions]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051120061856/http://www.mutanthigh.com/beef.html Information on Beef from Mutanthigh.com]\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Fabian Nicieza]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

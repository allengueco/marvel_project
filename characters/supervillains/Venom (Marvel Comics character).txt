After bonding with a human host, the Symbiote bestows its enhanced powers upon the host. When the Venom Symbiote bonds with a human, that new dual-life form usually refers to itself as "Venom".

He resorts to bonding with one of the men present, a discharged Army Ranger named Lee Price who was with Scorpion as part of Black Cat\'s gang. The weakened symbiote pleads with Price, attempting to convince him to become a hero like Thompson. Price ignores and overpowers it, intent on using it for personal gain as a new, wholly villainous Venom.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Costa|penciller = Gerardo Sandoval|inker = Gerardo Sandoval|colorist = Dono Sanchez Almara|letterer = VC\'s Clayton Cowles|editor = Devin Lewis|title = Venom|volume = 3|issue = #1|date = 23 November 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\nLee Price makes his way to Black Cat\'s hideout where Scorpion accuses him of botching the black market sale by causing the shoot-out.

Lee Price later gets attacked by Tombstone\'s minion Firebug. Upon defeating Firebug, an FBI Agent with a bazooka appears telling Lee Price that he is under arrest.<ref>\'\'Venom\'\' Vol. 3 #2</ref>\n\nLee Price eventually loses the symbiote when Eddie Brock and Spider-Man take him down and he is arrested by the NYPD.<ref name="auto"/>\n\nWhile incarcerated at the New York Corrections Supermax Facility for Superhuman Incarceration, Lee Price is feared by most of the inmates and he even defeats three inmates in the prison\'s cafeteria when they try to kill him to boost their reputation. Lee swears to get out, reclaim the Venom symbiote, and plan revenge on those who have wronged him.<ref>\'\'Venom\'\' #155</ref> Lee Price is later visited by his [[lawyer]] who tells him that two of the inmates he defeated had died in the infirmary and that Venom has resurfaced upon it being revealed in the news.<ref>\'\'Venom\'\' #157</ref> At the courthouse, Lee Price\'s lawyer stated that Lee\'s actions as Venom were caused by the Venom symbiote while the opposing lawyer mentions about Venom still being at large.

Venom\'s first host is actually a \'\'[[Kree]]\'\' soldier named [[Kree|Tel-Kar]]. The Kree, desiring to replicate \'\'[[Skrull]]\'\' shapeshifting abilities, obtain the newborn Venom, which had been outcast from the other symbiotes. Tel-Kar is recruited to be bonded to the newborn symbiote so that he can infiltrate the Skrull army. Tel-Kar\'s body is biologically altered so he can have full control over the symbiote\'s mind to the point of erasing its memories. Separated from Tel-Kar after his capture by the Skrulls, the symbiote goes on to be bonded to Spider-Man. \n\nTel-Kar escapes the Skrulls and wanders through the Galaxy until he hears of an agent from Earth called [[Flash Thompson]] with a black symbiote suit. Recognizing it as his symbiote, he goes to Earth to find it. Eddie Brock arrives with the symbiote and saves Tel-Kar from the Warbride Skrull M\'Lanz, who had followed him. Angered by Venom\'s refusal to return to him, Te-Kar threatens to kill Venom\'s latest offspring. Acceding to Tel-Kar, Venom reunites with him and they go to a Skrull research base to get a Skrull bioweapon. Simultaneously, Eddie is bonded to the offspring calling itself [[Symbiote (comics)|Sleeper]] and allies with M\'Lanz to stop Tel-Kar. During the ensuing battle, Tel-Kar concludes that he doesn\'t need Venom anymore and uses an electrified spear to detach himself from it. Later he is betrayed by the Kree Empire while Eddie escapes with Venom and M\'Lanz with Sleeper. Tel-Kar, now furious, attempts to release the bioweapon on Earth. Sleeper bonds to Tel-Kar and lobotomizes him. Sleeper, now with Tel\'Kar\'s body, wishes Eddie farewell and goes to explore the universe.<ref>\'\'Venom First Host\'\'</ref>\n\n===Other hosts===\n[[File:Brideofvenom.png|thumb|upright|right|Anne Weying, the bride of Venom]]\n\n====Anne Weying====\n{{main|Anne Weying}}\n\'\'\'Anne Weying\'\'\' first appears in \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #375. She is Eddie Brock\'s ex-wife and a successful lawyer. Weying assists Spider-Man by sharing some of Brock\'s history. Later, she follows Spider-Man to the amusement park where Venom had Peter\'s (fake) parents. She confronts Brock and manages to convince him to end his feud. After [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] shoots Ann as part of a crusade against social injustice, Ann becomes She-Venom when the Venom Symbiote temporarily bonds with her to save her life. She-Venom lashes out against the men who had hurt her, and Brock becomes afraid for her (and of her) and compels the Symbiote to return to him. Ann is left distraught at her actions while bonded. Later Ann is arrested on a false charge as part of a trap for Venom. She manages to warn Brock who sends the Symbiote to her, allowing her to become She-Venom and escape custody. Some time later, Ann, traumatized by her experiences with Venom and the Symbiote, commits suicide after seeing Spider-Man pass by her window in a black costume, believing it is Brock returning for her.<ref name="ASMv2#22"/>\n\n====Patricia Robertson====\n{{main|Patricia Robertson (comics)}}\nThe story follows U.S. Army communication specialist \'\'\'Patricia Robertson\'\'\'.<ref>\'\'Venom\'\' #1</ref> During a supply run to an Ararat Corporation owned outpost she discovers everyone at the installation dead except for one scientist. It is revealed that the Ararat Corporation is run by an alien colony of miniature spider robots led by an entity named Bob, that have infiltrated the American government. The Ararat Corporation has cloned Venom to facilitate the extermination of humanity, but the clone ravages its hosts. The clone is responsible for the death of the outpost crew.<ref>\'\'Venom\'\' #8</ref>\n\nRobertson finds an ally in the Suit, a mysterious individual made of the same miniature robots as Bob, revealed to have been accidentally brought to Earth by [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]].<ref>\'\'Venom\'\' #10</ref> The Suit modifies Robertson while she is unconscious to allow her to control the clone if it bonds with her. The Suit sabotages [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], the clones favored host, forcing it to bond with Robertson. One of Bob\'s agents convinces Robertston to kill the real Venom to save humanity, causing her to free the incarcerated Venom. She and Venom fight, but Venom escapes. Bob remotely deactivates the technology allowing Robertson to control the clone forcing her to rely on willpower. Later, Robertson and Venom again fight, and Venom absorbs the clone.<ref>\'\'Venom\'\' #17</ref> Venom decides to carry out the clone\'s mission given to it by the Ararat corporation. The series did not continue and the plot remained unresolved as of 2012. The Venom Symbiote would later regurgitate and expel the clone from its body, allowing it to bond with a teenager named Andrea "Andi" Benton. Taking the name Mania, Benton became Agent Venom\'s partner for a time.<ref>\'\'Venom\'\' (vol. 2) #38-42</ref>\n\n====Angelo Fortunato====\n\'\'\'Angelo Fortunato\'\'\' first appeared in \'\'[[Marvel Knights Spider-Man]]\'\' #7 and was killed in issue #8. Angelo is the son of [[Don Fortunato]], a prominent [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] capo. His frail physique and shy attitude leave Angelo frequently bullied and humiliated by his father. Don attends a supervillain auction and purchases the Venom Symbiote from Brock for $100 million. Brock warns Angelo of the Symbiote, but Angelo rebuffs him, saying that he has nothing to lose.<ref name=MKSpidey7>{{cite comic|writer=[[Mark Millar]]|penciller=[[Terry Dodson]]|inker=[[Rachel Dodson]]|story=Venomous, Part 3 of 4|title=[[Marvel Knights Spider-Man]]|issue=7|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=December 2004}}</ref> After bonding with the Symbiote, Angelo discovers the secret identity of Spider-Man, and attempts to kill him to prove his worth. Spider-Man ultimately defeats Angelo and when he tries to escape, the Symbiote abandons Angelo for his cowardice while he is leaping between buildings, leaving him to fall to his death. Spider-Man tried to save him, but he ran out of webs.<ref name=MKSpidey8>{{cite comic|writer=Mark Millar|penciller=Terry Dodson|inker=Rachel Dodson|story=Venomous, Part 4 of 4|title=Marvel Knights Spider-Man|issue=8|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=January 2005}}</ref>\n\n====Groot, Rocket Racoon and Drax====\nWhen Flash was part of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] he got separated from the symbiote and his team mates decided to send him to Earth. While traveling [[Groot]] accidentally bonds to the symbiote and started attacking the others. Then [[Rocket Racoon|Rocket]] tried to save his friend, but the symbiote left Groot and bonded to him. Then he tried to convince them to leave "his" ship, but [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]] grabbed Rocket by the tail and started bashing him to the walls until the symbiote bonded to Drax and defeated the whole team. Now the symbiote possessed Drax took control of the ship and went to  a planet formed from symbiotes named Klyntar (later revealed to be Knull\'s cage) where the symbiote got purified and rebonded to Flash.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[File:Venom Vol 3 1 Variant.png|thumb|upright|The Symbiote enhances the physical strength of its host. Art from the variant cover of \'\'Venom\'\' vol. 3, #1 (November 2016) by Clayton Crain.]]\nThough it requires a living host in order to survive, the Venom symbiote has been shown to be adept at fending for itself independent of a host. The Symbiote is capable of shapeshifting abilities, including the ability to form spikes or expand its size,<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Daniel Way]]|penciller=Francisco Herrera|inker=Carlos Lobo Cuevas|title=Venom|story=Patterns. Part 2|issue=12|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=2003}}</ref> as well as mimic the appearance of other humanoids after it has obtained a host. The organism can additionally use its shape-shifting abilities to conceal itself by altering its coloration or by becoming completely invisible. It also contains a small "dimensional aperture", allowing its hosts to carry items without adding mass to the costume. The Symbiote also exhibits telepathic abilities, primarily when it needs to communicate with its host.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nBecause of its contact with Spider-Man, the Symbiote grants all of its subsequent hosts that hero\'s powers and cannot be detected by his spider-sense. As Spider-Man\'s fighting style is partly dependent on his spider-sense, his effectiveness was somewhat hampered when he battled Eddie Brock. Retaining its memory from the time it was bonded with Spider-Man, Venom is also capable of producing webbing similar to Spider-Man\'s own variety created from itself.<ref name=ASM300/>\n\nThe Symbiote greatly enhances the physical strength of those it bonds with. Its hosts experience a vastly larger size and musculature. The Symbiote displays non-human teeth, which are very sharp, and commonly protrudes a long tongue from its mouth. Venom is depicted as being physically much bigger than Spider-Man, as well as having more brute strength.\n\nVenom exhibits some immunities to the supernatural powers of others such as the Penance Stare of [[Ghost Rider]] or Spider-Man\'s extrasensory spider-sense. \n\nSome incarnations of the Venom Symbiote have shown it able to replicate itself. This ability is shown in the 2005\xe2\x80\x932006 miniseries \'\'[[Spider-Man: Reign]]\'\', when Venom recreates his own Symbiote to combat his loneliness.\n\nThe Venom Symbiote is vulnerable to fire and sonic waves, causing it great pain and exhaustion if it sustains enough exposure. It can sense and track all of its offspring Symbiotes except [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], who learned how to block this ability shortly after bonding with Cletus Kasady and confronting Venom/Eddie Brock for the first time.<ref name=ASM361-363/>\n\nThe Venom symbiote is shown to form giant Web-like dragon wings when it was in contact with [[Symbiotes|Knull]].\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Main|Alternative versions of Venom}}\nAs a fictional character, Venom has appeared in various adaptations, from comic books to films and television series.

According to Kraft, he had been trying to link Lunatik to the \'\'Creatures on the Loose\'\' story arc during his time as writer on \'\'Defenders\'\', and his successor [[Ed Hannigan]] picked up on this, but made a different connection between the two than Kraft had had in mind.<ref name="Back65">{{cite journal |last=DeAngelo|first=Daniel|date=July 2013|title=The Not-Ready-For-Super-Team Players: A History of the Defenders|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65|pages=3-16 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> [[Keith Giffen]] stated, "Lunatik was a character I came up with in high school. When it went radically wrong, I went to [[DC Comics|DC]] [Comics and] took the basic concept of Lunatik and ... split [it] into two characters: [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] had his mercilessness, and [[Ambush Bug]] had his goofiness."<ref name="Back65"/>\n\nThe character subsequently appears in \'\'Defenders\'\' #51-53 (September-November 1977), #55-56 (January-February 1978), #61-62 (July-August 1978), #64-65 (October-November 1978), \'\'Marvel Premiere\'\' #45-46 (December 1978, February 1979), and \'\'Defenders\'\' #70-73 (April-July 1979). \n\nA different character named Lunatik appeared in \'\'[[Marvel Comics Presents]]\'\' #172-175 and \'\'Lunatik\'\' #1 (December 1995).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nArisen Tyrk was the tyrannical god-king of the dimension called [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|Other Realm]]. He seeks the power of the Godstone, which is bonded to [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] as the Man-Wolf. Tyrk hires [[Kraven the Hunter]] to attack Man-Wolf, but Man-Wolf fights Kraven off. Rebels from Other Realm bring the Man-Wolf to their land and he deposes Tyrk.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nTyrk tries to escape though an extra-dimensional portal, but the portal is damaged and fragments Tyrk into a number of forms in a number of realms. Four of Tyrk\'s fragments go to Earth, becoming the crazed Lunatik. These four duplicates of Tyrk plague the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] until they re-merge Lunatik into a more-or-less-whole Tyrk. He fights the Defenders in this form, but they eventually defeat him.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nFor a time he poses as drama professor Harrison Turk at [[Empire State University]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book |last=Sanderson |first=Peter |authorlink=  |title=The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |date= 2007 |location=New York City |pages=30\xe2\x80\x9333 |url= |doi= |isbn=1-4165-3141-6}}</ref>\n\n==Other characters named Lunatik==\nThere is also a cosmic mercenary by the name of Lunatik. He kills one of Tyrk\'s fragments, claiming that he doesn\'t like anyone else "using his name."{{issue|date=February 2013}} He first appeared in \'\'[[Marvel Comics Presents]]\'\' #172 (Jan 1995). This Lunatik is seen on a prison ship, the \'\'Dredge 01\'\', on its way to the [[Kyln]]. It crashes on Earth with [[Drax the Destroyer]], [[Paibok]], and the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]] as the only survivors. He seemingly meets his end at the Destroyer\'s hand.<ref>\'\'Drax The Destroyer: Earthfall\'\' #1-4</ref>\n\nThis Lunatik or a possible fragment appeared (in another prison) as Dirty Wolff in \'\'[[Deadpool]]\'\'.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n==In other media==\nThe \'\'[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]\'\' episode "Take the Milano and Run" features a different Lunatik voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. He owns a nightclub on the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]\'s space station Conjunction, and is an old contact of [[Star-Lord]]\'s.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/tyrkaris.htm|Lunatik (Arisen Tyrk)}}\n\n{{Defenders}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Keith Giffen]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1975]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

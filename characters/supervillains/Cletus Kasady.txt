He is usually depicted as an adversary to [[Spider-Man]], as well as serving as an enemy to [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]].\n\nIn 2009, Carnage was ranked as [[IGN]]\'s 90th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/90.html|title=Carnage is number 90|work=Comics|publisher=[[IGN]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715065142/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/90.html|archivedate=2013-07-15 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>\n==Publication history==\nWriter [[David Michelinie]] intended to have Venom\'s human alter ego, [[Eddie Brock]], be killed off in \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #400 and have the symbiote continue to bond with a series of hosts. However, as Brock and Venom\'s popularity increased, Marvel would not allow him to be killed. Michelinie decided to create a new character: a total psychopath who, unlike Venom, had no sense of morality.  The human component of Carnage\xe2\x80\x99s first host, Cletus Kasady, was designed by artist [[Erik Larsen]], who modeled the character after the [[DC Comics]] supervillain [[Joker (character)|the Joker]].<ref name="Cletus Kasady question">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=27774 |title=Cletus Kasady (question for Erik) (one post from a messageboard thread) |accessdate=2007-06-24 |author=Erik Larsen |date=2007-03-27 |publisher=Image Comics Community |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210624/http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=27774 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}</ref>\n\nKasady was introduced in \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #344 and first appears as Carnage in issue #361.<ref>{{cite book|last = Cowsill|first = Alan|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 197|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Artist Mark Bagley\'s era of \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' hit its stride as Carnage revealed the true face of his evil.

He is a deeply disturbed individual with a dark past: as a child, he killed his grandmother by pushing her down a flight of stairs, tried to murder his mother by throwing a hair dryer into her bathtub, and [[cruelty to animals|tortured]] and killed his mother\'s dog with a drill. After the latter, his mother then tried to kill Kasady, and was apparently beaten to the brink of death by Kasady\'s father, who received no defense from Kasady during the trial. As an [[orphan]], Kasady was sent to the St. Estes Home for Boys, where his [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] behavior made him the target of abuse from both the other orphans and the staff. Kasady gained revenge by murdering the disciplinarian administrator, pushing a girl (who laughed at him for asking to date her) in front of a moving bus, and burning down the orphanage. It was during his brutal years at St. Estes that Kasady acquired his philosophy that life was essentially meaningless and futile, that "laws are only words",<ref name="ASM 362">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #362</ref> and came to see the spreading of chaos through random, unpatterned bloodshed as "the ultimate freedom".<ref name="ASM 379">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #379</ref>\n\n===Rebirth===\nKasady became a [[serial killer]]. He was then captured and sent to Ryker\'s Island prison for 11 murders\xe2\x80\x94though he bragged about killing a dozen more<ref name="ASM 361">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #361</ref>\xe2\x80\x94where he shared a [[prison cell|cell]] with [[Eddie Brock]], the host of the alien symbiote that turns into the supervillain [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. When Brock\'s symbiote soon returned to be bonded again, allowing Venom to escape prison, the symbiote unknowingly left its offspring in the cell; due to its alien mindset, the symbiote felt no emotional attachment to its offspring, regarding it as insignificant, and thus never communicated its existence to Brock via their telepathic link. The new symbiote then bonded with Kasady, transforming him into Carnage.<ref name="ASM 344-345">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #344\xe2\x80\x93345</ref>  The bond between the Carnage symbiote and Kasady was stronger than the bond between Brock and the Venom symbiote. As a result, Carnage is far more violent, powerful, and deadly than Venom.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> He escaped prison,<ref name="ASM 359">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #359</ref> and began a series of murders, and at the scene of each crime, wrote "Carnage" on the walls with his own blood. He was found by [[Spider-Man]], though the hero proved to be no match for Carnage\'s powers. In desperation, Spider-Man made a truce with Venom to fight Carnage.<ref name="ASM 361" /> The Carnage symbiote was defeated and apparently destroyed with [[sonic weapon]]ry, but unbeknownst to them the symbiote\xe2\x80\x99s deeper equilibrium with its host helped to save it. After entering Kasady\xe2\x80\x99s body through a small cut, it bonded to his blood (which caused its red coloration).<ref name="Max Carnage">\'\'\'\'\'Maximum Carnage\'\'\'\'\': \'\'Spider-Man Unlimited\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x932; \'\'Web of Spider-Man\'\' #101\xe2\x80\x93103; \'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #378\xe2\x80\x93380; \'\'Spider-Man\'\' #35\xe2\x80\x9337; \'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #201\xe2\x80\x93203</ref>\n\n===\'\'Maximum Carnage\'\'===\n{{See also|Maximum Carnage}}\nKasady is taken to [[Vault (comics)|The Vault]], a prison for super-villains\xe2\x80\x94then Ravencroft Institute, a facility for the super-human criminally insane. A doctor at the facility, hoping to find a "cure" for his madness, draws blood from him\xe2\x80\x94unwittingly enabling Kasady to transform into Carnage\xe2\x80\x94who goes on to recruit an army of [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] supervillains including [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], [[Demogoblin]], [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]], and [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] to take over [[New York City]]. Using Shriek\'s "psychic channel" powers, he also drives ordinary New Yorkers to attack one another. Carnage and his "family" are ultimately driven back by Spider-Man, Venom and a number of other superheroes and super-[[antihero]]es, with Carnage and Shriek being remanded to Ravencroft.<ref name="Max Carnage"/>\n\n===Web of Carnage===\nDuring a subsequent jailbreak he made it his mission to kill his only childhood friend Billy Bentime, hoping to refute the notion that friendship should be paid in kind. Carnage nearly defeated Spider-Man until Bentime tricked Carnage into reverting to human form enabling Spider-Man to knock out Kasady with a simple punch.<ref name="ASM Annual 28">\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man Annual\'\' #28</ref>\n\nThough bonded to Kasady\'s bloodstream the symbiote found a way to ditch its host by travelling through the institute\'s water pipes, its absence leaving Kasady increasingly weakened, initially taking control of John Jameson before it eventually transferred itself to Spider-Man (currently [[Ben Reilly]]). Reilly attempted to destroy the symbiote by subjecting himself to a potentially lethal burst of microwave energy, but the symbiote fled back to the weakening Kasady.<ref name="Spider-Carnage">\'\'Sensational Spider-Man\'\' #3, \'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #410, \'\'Spider-Man\'\' #67, and \'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #233</ref>\n\nLater, Kasady was able to escape his prison when a new governor at Ravencroft decided to try and save money by turning off some of the defences around Kasady\'s cell, underestimating the level of awareness the symbiote had of its surroundings. During this escape, it was confronted by Spider-Man and the [[Silver Surfer]], the symbiote - driven to a panic due to genetic memories of Galactus devouring a planet of symbiotes - parting from Kasady and bonding to the Surfer to stop him, while Spider-Man was forced to take Kasady to the hospital. Learning that the killer was dying of a stomach cancer that had been kept in check by the symbiote, Spider-Man was forced to help the Surfer return the symbiote to Kasady to save his life, but the Surfer then sealed Kasady in an unbreakable prison in an attempt to force him to reflect on his sins for eternity.<ref name="ASM 430-431">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #430\xe2\x80\x93431</ref>\n\n===Death and resurrection===\nHaving tracked Kasady to a prison specially designed to hold him\xe2\x80\x94how he escaped Silver Surfer\'s prison was never established\xe2\x80\x94Venom eventually reabsorbs the Carnage symbiote into his own body "for good". Without the symbiote, Kasady attempts to re-assume the Carnage persona by costuming himself in red paint and continuing his killing sprees, claiming that he still possesses at least some of Carnage\'s strength and convinced that he only needs to kill Spider-Man and Venom to regain his symbiote, but Spider-Man nevertheless easily defeats him in a fight.<ref name="PP: SM Vol2 13">\'\'Peter Parker: Spider-Man, Vol. 2\'\' #13</ref> Kasady later ended in the [[Negative Zone]], where he was guided by the remnants of the Carnage symbiote to another symbiote that was kept sealed somewhere in the Zone, and as he bonded with it, allowed the remnants of the Carnage symbiote to absorb it in the process and resurrect itself to once again become Carnage.<ref name="Web-Spinners 14">\'\'Web-Spinners\'\' #14</ref>\n\n===Breakout===\nCarnage is one of several [[supervillain]]s trying to escape from The Raft.<ref name="The Avengers 1-2">\'\'[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x932</ref> [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] flies Carnage outside the [[Earth]]\'s [[atmosphere]] and rips him in two.\n\n===Family Feud===\nIt is revealed that Kasady is alive (although both of his legs have been severed), his body preserved by the symbiote and repaired by Hall\'s prosthetics.<ref name="Carnage"/> Kasady reclaims the symbiote and becomes Carnage once more, attempting to avenge his captivity while Spider-Man and [[Iron Man]] struggle to stop him. It is then revealed that Carnage is once again pregnant, and the suit\'s spawn briefly bonds to Shriek before being torn from her. Scared of Shriek\'s malice, the symbiote arm then bonds to Tanis, creating a new hero, Scorn, who defeats Shriek and forces her to use her sonic shriek to weaken Carnage for Spider-Man and Iron Man. Carnage, however, escapes with the Doppelganger and swears to make a bloody comeback.<ref name= "Carnage">\'\'Carnage\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x935</ref>  \n\n===Carnage USA===\nIn the aftermath of his return, Carnage sets off west to Doverton, Colorado.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16101/carnage_usa|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712033608/http://marvel.com/news/story/16101/carnage_usa|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-12|title=Saladin Ahmed Shares a Preview of MS.

[[Captain America]], Spider-Man, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] attempt to defeat him but all except Spider-Man are bonded to copies. With the Avengers team compromised and Spider-Man out of communication, they send in another team consisted of symbiote-enhanced special forces. Dr. Tanis Nieves as Scorn goes along with the separated parts of Hybrid which make up Agony, Phage, Riot, and Lasher, but they are heavily outnumbered since Carnage controls the entire town. Captain America breaks free of his hold long enough to make an emergency call for back up to none other than Venom. [[Flash Thompson]] in the Venom symbiote  sets off to Colorado to kill Carnage. The enhanced special forces keep fighting but Carnage sends the controlled Avengers after them, that was when Spider-Man comes with the unaffected residents of the town. The melee is particularly fierce when Venom intervenes with sonic rounds. Venom is about to kill Carnage with a gun in the mouth but Spider-Man stops him. Before Venom or Carnage can recover, Scorn uses a construction vehicle to carry the two to a device she built. She reveals that her device is meant to permanently remove the bonds from Carnage and Venom, but the hosts are still in there, leaving Kasady alone with a legless Flash Thompson. After the symbiotes fighting with themselves and the Avengers team, Venom finds its way back to Flash Thompson while Scorn is able to capture and contain the Carnage symbiote. The series ends with Kasady being captured and dragged into the back of a prison vehicle.<ref>\'\'Carnage USA\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x935</ref>\n\n===Minimum Carnage===\nCarnage escapes prison yet again with the help of microns. Agent Venom is sent to the prison and discovers Kasady has escaped. Carnage flees to Houston, Texas and causes havoc, attracting the attention of the [[Scarlet Spider]]. Carnage takes the scientist Dr. Ketola, an expert in inter-dimensional transportation, as a hostage and escapes into the Microverse.<ref>\'\'Minimum Carnage Alpha\'\'</ref> He is defeated by Venom and Scarlet Spider, who use a sonic bomb from the Microverse to temporarily separate Kasady from the symbiote. Scarlet Spider then impales Kasady through the eye, lobotomizing him. Carnage goes into a catatonic state: The symbiote is keeping his body alive, similar to a life-support system, but Kasady\'s brain and mind are believed to be irreparably damaged, leaving the symbiote in control.<ref>\'\'Minimum Carnage Omega\'\'</ref>\n\n===Superior Carnage===\nKasady, now lobotomized, later broken out of prison by the [[Wizard (comics)|Wizard]] and [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], who intend to recruit him into the Frightful Four and turn him into their own version of Venom. Carnage breaks free from Wizard\'s control and nearly kills him, but is subdued by Klaw. Taking Carnage into their hideout, Wizard tries to take control of Kasady\'s mind, but fails due to it being too damaged. Wizard then transfers the Symbiote to Dr. [[Karl Malus]] who dubs himself "Superior Carnage". <ref name = "SupCar">\'\'Superior Carnage\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x935</ref>\n\nWizard blows up the hideout with Kasady still inside, seemingly killing him. While storming the city hall, Superior Carnage states that Kasady was a fool who wasted so much time on chaos while there was much more to be accomplished with a little focus.<ref name = "SupCar"/>\n\nUltimately, Spider-Man brings out Kasady\'s body to successfully draw the symbiote into it, which immediately devours Dr. Malus and then prepares to finish off the Wizard. However, Klaw ephemeral spirit focuses his sound manipulation powers one last time for a split second to create a powerful sonic blast that disables Carnage, allowing the symbiote to be recaptured. In the epilogue it is shown that the symbiote has managed to repair the Wizard\'s and Kasady\'s brain damage, followed by Kasady writing "CARNAGE RULES" on his cell wall.<ref name = "SupCar"/>\n\nA piece of the symbiote (which had died in captivity) escapes containment and sets out in search of Kasady, who is bedridden due to having been stabbed by a fellow prison inmate. A doctor, anticipating that the symbiote will come seeking Kasady, smothers the killer in the infirmary, wanting the alien for himself. When the symbiote breaks into the facility, the doctor offers himself to the creature, but it rejects him, and returns to Kasady after resuscitating him.

While fighting, Nova tried to convince him that he wasn\'t Sam Alexander, but the maniac didn\'t believe him. After being wounded by the Nova Force, Kasady fled in order to let his symbiote heal him as the police arrived.

Enraged, Carnage followed the false Nova, but lost sight of her. He then started to attack innocent people to try to get Nova\'s attention, which he got. A new battle ensued between them both. Carnage was taken by Nova to the sky and then punched him into the parking lot below, the impact setting off the cars\' alarms, dizzying Kasady and his symbiote.

As the symbiote screamed in pain, Kasady fled from there to the road, but was attacked by Nova again. He threw a car at Nova, who caught it midair, and took advantage of it to punch him. Ready to finish off his opponent, Carnage was hit by a truck. He was then tied in metal plates by Nova and left by his symbiote as he revealed he wanted to kill Nova because he wanted to erase any memory of his good deeds, from the time he had his moral axis inverted, from anyone who remembered it.

He battled both Venom and Spider-Man, nearly decapitating the former and impaling the latter. He was ultimately tossed into space by Venom and Danger, becoming one of the few Poisons to survive the death of the Poison Queen.<ref>\'\'Venomized\'\' #5</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n===\'\'Spider-Man and Batman: Disordered Minds\'\'===\nCarnage teams up with the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and later turns against him during \'\'[[Spider-Man and Batman: Disordered Minds]]\'\' #1, the two men meeting when behavioral psychiatrist Cassandra Briar attempts to use the two men\xe2\x80\x94regarded as humanity\'s most twisted minds\xe2\x80\x94as tests for a chip she has developed that will allegedly \'lobotomise\' their homicidal instincts. However, the Carnage symbiote neutralizes Kasady\'s chip after it is implanted, with Kasady simply pretending that the chip had worked so that he could meet the Joker. After Carnage removes Joker\'s chip, the two psychotics briefly enter into an alliance before their differing methods of murder cause a clash; Carnage favors numbers and actually seeing the death of his victims close-up in his murder sprees while the Joker prefers the artistry of his usual traps and tricks, Carnage dismissing the Joker\'s methods as slow while Joker sees Carnage as an amateur as anyone can just go out and kill people. Carnage responds by ambushing and threatening to kill [[Batman]] in order to be "theatrical". Carnage is defeated by Batman in the subsequent fight when he loses control of his symbiote while panicking after the Joker threatens to set off a bomb to destroy [[Gotham City|Gotham]]\xe2\x80\x94 himself and Carnage included\xe2\x80\x94 rather than see Carnage kill Batman. While defeating the shaken Kasady after his panic causes him to lose control of the symbiote, Batman reflects that many serial killers kill so many to try to escape death themselves by "appeasing" the Grim Reaper with their own sacrifices, and that Carnage\xe2\x80\x94far from being a monster or even a "common street punk"\xe2\x80\x94 is little more than an overgrown "little boy", albeit with lethal powers.<ref name="SM & B 1">\'\'Spider-Man and Batman\'\' #1</ref>\n\n===Venomverse===\nHailing from a world where he had succeeded in killing Venom, Carnage was summoned at the behest of the Venom of the Prime Marvel Universe to help win the war between Venoms and Poisons.

He appeared in the episodes "Venom Returns" and "Carnage". Cletus is captured by the police after planning to explode a bomb over New York. In prison, he shares a cell with [[Eddie Brock]]. After the original symbiote goes in their prison and rebonds with Brock and escapes, [[Baron Mordo]] appears in front of Cletus and explains that another symbiote has the same symbiotic powers. When Mordo makes a deal with this symbiote power in exchange for servitude to [[Dormammu]], Cletus accepts the offer and bonds with the new symbiote, turning into Carnage and escapes the prison. Carnage and Venom are given vampiric powers to steal life energy so that Dormammu can escape into this dimension and consume. Carnage mockingly refers to Venom as Dad. Carnage abducts [[Ashley Kafka]], resulting in Venom teaming up with [[Spider-Man]] and [[Iron Man]]. After the final showdown, Carnage tried to drag Ashley into Dormammu\'s realm with him, but Eddie sacrificed himself to save Ashley and falls through the portal with Carnage.

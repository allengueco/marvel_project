During an experiment with a [[bismuth]] isotope, Paul Rodgers accidentally struck a normal scorpion with a stream of [[delta particle]]s. It was mutated into a giant monstrous form and gained the consciousness to hate the human race. It told Paul Rodgers and Edward Bentley that it would mutate another bunch of scorpions and take over the world. Edward managed to hypnotize the Scorpion that it was feeling the pains from the radiation poisoning. When the Scorpion begged for Paul and Edward to end its life, they complied and killed the Scorpion by firing another stream of delta particles at it.<ref>\'\'Journey into Mystery\'\' #82</ref>\n\n===Sam Scorpio===\n\'\'\'Sam Scorpio\'\'\' is an inventor who used his "sting" (a derringer fitted to a silencer on his forearm) to terrorize the [[American frontier|Old West]]. Scorpion later encountered [[Kid Colt]] while running from a 50-man posse and begged for his help. Kid Colt refused until an earthquake occurred and they hid under a boulder. By the time Kid Colt and Scorpion emerged, the posse caught up to them and they were taken to prison. While in jail, Scorpion used his "sting" on a guard. Upon grabbing the guard\'s keys, Scorpion forced Kid Colt to accompany him. He took Kid Colt to a hideout in the hills and wanted Kid Colt to join him. When Kid Colt asked about the secret of his "sting," Scorpion turned on him. Kid Colt shot out the lamp for cover from Scorpion\'s sting and Scorpion fled where he told the posse where they can find Kid Colt. Afterwards, Scorpion set up a gang where he kept them in line with his "sting." Kid Colt went after Scorpion\'s gang upon figuring out what his gimmick was. Kid Colt defeated Scorpion\'s gang and defeated Scorpion in hand-to-hand combat before he could use his "sting." Kid Colt then turned Scorpion and his gang over to the authorities.<ref>\'\'Kid Colt, Outlaw\'\' #115</ref>\n\nScorpion was imprisoned in a State Prison where he was part of a chain gang with Dr. Danger and Bull Barton.

Then they grazed Kid Colt with another bullet and fled. Across the border, Scorpion, Dr. Danger, and Bull Barton came across a town where Fred Yates (the man that Kid Colt turned himself over to) lived. When Scorpion, Dr. Danger, and Bull Barton confronted Fred Yates and his sister Susan, Fred fled in sheer terror. Kid Colt caught up to the trio, disarmed them, and saved Susan. Kid Colt then sent Scorpion, Dr. Danger, and Bull Barton back over the border to the waiting arms of the law.<ref>\'\'Kid Colt, Outlaw\'\' #118</ref>\n\n===Mac Gargan===\n{{main|Mac Gargan}}\n\'\'\'Mac Gargan\'\'\' first appeared in \'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #19 and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

Jim drew his gun first and only managed to wing Matt in the left arm as Matt managed to shoot Jim\'s gun out of his hand. Matt then made Jim dance with his gun. Jim was humiliated and vowed revenge. Upon inventing a liquid paralytic that he can fire no matter where he would hit them, Jim took on the identity of Scorpion and embarked on a crime spree. Scorpion managed to hold up a stagecoach and the sound of his gun attracted the attention of [[Rawhide Kid]]. Rawhide Kid managed to tackle Scorpion who hit Rawhide Kid with a paralytic pellet and continued to rob the stagecoach where he made off with the payroll. Upon questioning the nearby town about Scorpion, Rawhide Kid learned that there had been an apothecary who had been around for four months which allowed Rawhide Kid to determine his identity. Rawhide Kid followed Jim to an abandoned mine, watched him change into Scorpion, and then confronted him. Their fight collapsed the mine and Rawhide Kid fell into an underground stream. Rawhide Kid recovered and went after Scorpion again. When Scorpion fired the paralytic pellet again, Rawhide Kid twisted Scorpion\'s wrist causing Scorpion to get hit by his own paralytic pellet.

Phantom Rider managed to defeat Sting-Ray and unmasked him after he was distracted by Natalie\'s shouting. The sheriff and his men arrived and chased after Phantom Rider.

He is an old enemy of Spider-Man, having fought him several times in the past, just like [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]. After Otto Octavius, now [[Doctor Octopus]], attacks Ryker\'s Island and the Raft, all four of them, as well as [[Mister Negative]], are freed and Otto recruits them to form the [[Sinister Six]], promising to fulfill each one\'s desires (with Scorpion\'s wish being that of expunging his criminal record). Spider-Man is easily defeated by the combined forces of the Sinister Six, but not killed because, as it is revealed at the end of the game, Otto is aware of his secret identity. The Sinister Six then split up to fulfill their respective tasks, with Rhino and Scorpion being sent to poison the city\'s reservoir. Spider-Man stops them, but Scorpion injects him with his poison, which causes him strange hallucinations before it would eventually kill him. However, Spider-Man manages to create and inject himself with an antitode just in time. Rhino and Scorpion are later seen at the docks, fighting some [[Silver Sable|Sable]] Interational mercenaries and trying to destroy the medical deliveres for the people infected with Devil\'s Breath. [[Miles Morales]] encounters the two while there and manages to escape, warning Peter Parker about it. Spider-Man later arrives at the docks and manages to defeat Rhino and Scorpion, trapping them in a container until the police would take them back into custody.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Scorpion (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Silver Scorpion]], a Marvel Comics superheroine who was a member of the Invaders.\n* [[Scorpia (comics)|Scorpia]], a Marvel Comics supervillainess who was a female counterpart to Mac Gargan.\n* [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]], a number of Marvel Comics characters with the same alias.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/scorpionjim.htm Scorpion (monster)] at Marvel Appendix\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/scorpionkc.htm Scorpion (Sam Scorpio)] at Marvel Appendix\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/stingraw.htm Scorpion (Jim Evans)] at Marvel Appendix\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Scorpion_%28Ultimate%29 Ultimate Scorpion] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Scorpion Scorpion (disambiguation)] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Peter_Parker_%28Scorpion%29_%28Earth-1610%29 Ultimate Scorpion] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120531065853/http://marvel.wikia.com/Kron_Stone_(Earth-3432) Scorpion 2099] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Ultimate Spider-Man}}\n{{Spider-Man}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Western (genre) characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1962]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1964]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]'

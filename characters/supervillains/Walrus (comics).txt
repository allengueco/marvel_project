He is the enemy of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Frog-Man]].\n\n==Publication history==\nWalrus first appeared in \'\'[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]\'\' #131 (May 1984) and was created by [[J. M. DeMatteis|J.M. DeMatteis]], [[Peter Gillis]], and [[Alan Kupperberg]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Walrus is a supervillain and foe of Spider-Man. He wears a costume that resembles a [[walrus]] and despite being physically strong, proved to be completely inept at villainy. While most supervillains are interested in stealing money or taking over the world, the Walrus was content with mindless property damage. He considered his role as a supervillain as that of a "mass-destructionist".\n\nThe man who would one day don the guise of the savage Walrus was once a cab driver named \'\'\'Hubert Carpenter\'\'\' (a reference to "[[The Walrus and the Carpenter]]" poem from \'\'[[Through the Looking-Glass]]\'\'). Hubert\'s uncle Humbert (a [[mad scientist]]/eccentric [[janitor]]) used devious experimental technology to endow Hubert with the attributes that would surely make him into the preeminent supervillain of all times. Hubert, now with the "proportionate speed, strength and agility of a walrus", started causing havoc.\n\nHe fought the [[New Defenders]] and the second [[Frog-Man]], before collapsing.<ref>\'\'Defenders #131\'\'</ref> Then he teamed up with the deadly and nefarious [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]], forming the Terrible Two. He and his partner fought Spider-Man and were easily beaten. One of their common goals was to murder Frog-Man, who had humiliated them both in the past. However, it was soon revealed that Frog-Man had little to worry about, as the Walrus is the sort of supervillain that has to wear velcro shoes in order to avoid accidentally tying his shoes to each other. The Walrus is not the smartest villain, as he tends to make the most stupid remarks, which even made Spider-Man laugh uncontrollably at him, allowing the Walrus to punch and knock him down.<ref name="Spectacular Spider-Man (vol. 1) #185">\'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' (vol. 1) #185</ref> The fact that the Walrus also wears a large rainbow "W" on the front of his costume also tends to make his enemies laugh at him.\n\nThe Walrus later appears with [[Mr. Fish]] in an exotic night club where he\'s seen admiring an overweight dancer.<ref>\'\'Daughters of the Dragon\'\' #4</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\'\' storyline, [[Deadpool]] sees the chaos caused by the Worthy and manipulates Walrus into thinking that he has been chosen to wield a magical hammer so that he can improve his security consolation business. However, his plan goes awry when the hammer turns out to be the property of a group of [[werewolf|werewolves]] called the Moon-Born. The hammer exhibits special properties under the full moon which Deadpool discovers when he engages the Walrus in battle. Deadpool managed to trick Walrus into entering the windowless basement of a sheriff\'s office where the hammer became powerless and he could take advantage of the sheriff\'s weapon\'s cache.<ref>\'\'Fear Itself: Deadpool\'\' #1-3</ref>\n\nWalrus partners with White Rabbit and the new [[Goldbug (comics)|Goldbug]] during \'\'[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]\'\' for a plan that involves tampering with New York City\'s drinking water. The three are defeated by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], and taken to a new supervillain prison called the Cellar, which is secretly run by [[List of Marvel Comics characters: R#Regent|Regent]]. After being checked in, Walrus and [[Ox (comics)|Ox]] are separated from the other prisoners, and seemingly killed when they are sealed in power-siphoning tubes by Regent\'s servant Dr. Shannon Stillwell.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dennis Hopeless|penciller = Javier Rodriguez|inker = Alvaro Lopez|colorist = Javier Rodriguez|letterer = VC\'s Travis Lanham|editor = Nick Lowe|story = What to Expect|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 4|issue = #1|date = 7 October 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Slott and Christos Gage|penciller = Paco Diaz|inker = Paco Diaz|colorist = Israel Silva|letterer = VC\'s Joe Caramagna|editor = Nick Lowe|story = The Cellar|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 4|issue = #2|date = 7 November 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\nWalrus survived and was released after Regent\'s defeat. He was later subsequently abducted and placed in [[Murderworld (comics)|Murderworld]] by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] alongside the other Murderworld captives. Walrus was later rescued by [[Gwenpool]] with the help of Deadpool.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Christopher Hastings|penciller = Alti Firmansyan and Gurihiru|inker = Alti Firmansyan and Gurihiru|colorist = Rachelle Rosenberg and Gurihiru|letterer = VC\'s Clayton Cowles|editor = Heather Antos|title = The Unbelievable Gwenpool|volume = 1|issue = #13|date = 8 March 2017|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nHubert claimed to have the proportionate speed, strength, and agility of a walrus.<ref name="Spectacular Spider-Man (vol. 1) #185"/> The Walrus does appear to possess some measure of superhuman strength, agility and endurance. He was actually able to hit Spider-Man with sufficient force to knock him flying, rip a metal lamp post in half and withstand razor sharp and explosive carrots fired at him by the White Rabbit as a test. However, on another occasion, Spider-Man was able to defeat the Walrus by flicking him with his index finger, which knocked him out. He also has the ability to distract his enemies by making them laugh uncontrollably with his stupid remarks.\n\nIt was revealed that he had been mutagenically altered by his uncle with walrus DNA which would presumably add certain walrus characteristics to his physiology, such as a layer of blubber to keep him warm in freezing water and the ability to hold his breath for a much longer time than a human. While none of these abilities would be very useful to a supervillain who never goes anywhere near water, the layer of blubber could explain his resistance to injury.\n\nThe Walrus was noticeably unintelligent, but was unusually good at [[crossword]] puzzles.{{issue|date=August 2013}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Hubert_Carpenter_%28Earth-616%29 Walrus] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://comicvine.gamespot.com/walrus/4005-15282/ Walrus] at Comic Vine\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/walrus.htm|Walrus}}\n\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional taxicab drivers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\n[[Category:Characters created by J.

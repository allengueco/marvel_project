In an experiment with the Primus/Arnim Zola imposter, his skin becomes a light pinkish fur color and he ends up resembling a cannibalistic, humanoid [[rat]]. Vermin is defeated by [[Captain America]] and turned over to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #272</ref> He escapes S.H.I.E.L.D., however, and returns to the service of Zola and Zemo. Vermin is shackled by Zemo with Captain America in a dungeon; he battles, mutates, escapes, and wounds Zemo.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #275-278</ref>\n\nVermin later battles Captain America and [[Spider-Man]] at a street festival and is captured.<ref>\'\'Marvel Team-Up\'\' #128</ref> Some time later, Vermin kidnaps women off the streets into the sewers, murders and devours them. He is defeated and captured by [[Kraven the Hunter]] disguised as Spider-Man; Kraven sought to prove himself superior to Spider-Man by defeating Vermin alone when Spider-Man needed Captain America to help him. He is forced by Kraven to battle the real Spider-Man, then allowed to escape; he is finally captured and turned over to the police by Spider-Man.<ref>\'\'Web of Spider-Man\'\' #31-32; \'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #293-294; \'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #131-132</ref> During the breakout from the supervillain prison the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], Vermin assists [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] in hunting down Warden Marsh. Under Venom\'s orders, Vermin later teams with [[Powderkeg]] and [[Mentallo]]; they temporarily defeat [[Iron Man]] and [[Hank Pym]]. Mentallo\'s powers are used to neutralize the break out.<ref>\'\'Avengers: Deathtrap, The Vault\'\' #1</ref>\n\nVermin eventually escapes the asylum, and attacks his parents at their home in Scarsdale. He is captured by Spider-Man and returned to psychiatric care. In response to treatment from Dr. Ashley Kafka, he temporarily reverts to his human form.<ref name="SSM178"/>\n\nUnder continued treatment from Dr. Kafka, Whelan\'s original human form eventually becomes his default state, and he only changes to Vermin for a few hours at a time. He and Kafka are [[kidnap]]ped by a group of other Zemo mutants, who want Whelan to become Vermin again and lead them in their quest for revenge. Instead, Whelan persuades them to surrender themselves for psychiatric treatment so that they can be cured as he was. However, Baron Zemo uses a mind-control device to take control of the mutates and revert Whelan to Vermin, intending to use them as subjects for further experiments. His will strengthened by his psychiatric care, Whelan partially reverts to human form and attacks Zemo. Dr. Kafka convinces him to not kill Zemo, and by letting go of his hate Whelan allows "Vermin" to finally die. No longer confined to psychiatric institutions, he submits to trial for his crimes as Vermin. Top defense attorney [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] agrees to be his lawyer for the case.<ref>\'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #194-196</ref>\n\nWhelan reverts to his Vermin state once again when he teams up with Bloodscream to fight Wolverine.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' (vol. 2) #170</ref> During the breakout of the Raft orchestrated by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], Vermin attacks Spider-Man after [[Count Nefaria]] knocks him into a hole with the other escaping villains. He is later seen fighting Captain America.<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' #1-2 Jan-Feb 2005</ref>\n\nVermin is later incarcerated in New York\'s experimental "Ant-Hill" prison, where all prisoners are reduced in size thanks to Hank Pym\'s Pym particles. An escape attempt is thwarted by [[She-Hulk]].<ref>\'\'She-Hulk\'\' #5-6</ref>\n\nVermin is among the villains recruited to join the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]\'s crime syndicate. He helps them fight the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], but is taken down by [[Doctor Strange]].<ref>\'\'New Avengers Annual\'\' #2</ref> In \'\'[[Secret Invasion]]\'\', he is among the many supervillains who rejoins the Hood\'s crime syndicate. Vermin, the Syndicate and an army of heroes attack and defeat an invading [[Skrull]] force in [[Central Park]].<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' #46</ref> He joins with the Hood\'s gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' #50</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\'\' storyline, Vermin attacks Spider-Man, who is struggling to deal with the fear and chaos that is gripping Manhattan.<ref>\'\'Fear Itself: Spider-Man\'\' #2</ref>\n\nVermin returns in the \'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' storyline "Kraven\'s First Hunt". He attacks the new [[Kraven the Hunter (Ana Kravinoff)|Kraven the Hunter]] for intruding on his tunnels, and is beaten by her very badly. He escapes outside and runs into Spider-Man, who is wearing a [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] costume. Not recognizing his old foe, Vermin attacks, overwhelming him, and taking a bite out of his shoulder.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #566</ref> Up close, Vermin is able to identify Spider-Man\'s scent. Appealing to the last shred of humanity within Vermin, Spider-Man convinces him to reveal where Kraven is. Vermin later attacks Kraven again, but is defeated and captured by her.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #567</ref>\n\nAs part of the \'\'[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]\'\', Vermin appears as a member of [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]]\'s [[Revengers|New Revengers]].<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' Vol. 4 #7</ref>\n\nDuring the "Search for Tony Stark" arc, Vermin rejoined Hood\'s gang and assisted in the attack on Castle Doom.<ref>\'\'Invincible Iron Man\'\' #597. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nVermin\'s strength was enhanced by the experimental mutagenic process designed by [[Arnim Zola]], and forced upon him. His agility, reflexes, and durability are roughly equivalent to the absolute peak attainable for the human body but, unlike his strength, speed and stamina, they do not reach superhuman levels. He has extremely acute senses, particularly his sense of smell. Vermin has inch-long claw-like fingernails, razor-sharp pointed teeth, and fur covering most of his body, giving him the appearance of a humanoid rat. Eventually, Vermin gained the ability to revert to human form at will.\n\nVermin has the ability to control rats and stray dogs within a two-mile (3&nbsp;km) radius of his person. It has not been clearly explained how he does this but some writers have implied it might be hyper-sonic communication.\n\nThough Vermin has no formal martial arts training, he utilizes bestial ferocity, animal cunning, and instincts which make him a very formidable hand-to-hand combatant. He once bested Spider-Man in a physical struggle, but [[Kraven the Hunter]] prevented Vermin from killing Spider-Man.\n\n===Special skills===\nBefore being altered by Zola, Whelan was an accomplished geneticist.  As Vermin, his intellect is reduced to a childlike (yet cunning) level and he suffers from paranoid delusions.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, not much is known about this reality\'s version of Edward Whelan other than the fact that he used to work for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] before it\'s dissolution. This led to him living in the sewers where he had a psychic connection with Agent Crock. Vermin and Agent Crock ruled the sewers with an iron fist until they encountered the Young Ultimates during their search for [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. After being unable to reason with them, [[Alternative versions of Kitty Pryde#Shadowcat|Shadowcat]] phased through Agent Crock\'s head enough to kill him and even Vermin as a side effect of their psychic connection.<ref>\'\'All-New Ultimates\'\' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n* Vermin was originally going to appear in the sewer in the 1995 \'\'[[Spider-Man (1995 video game)|Spider-Man]]\'\' video game. His sprite was given hair in the final versions of the game.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n* Vermin appears in 2012 \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' video game, with its vocal effects provided by [[Steven Blum]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} This version is an ordinary rat who was injected with human DNA by Edward Whelan,<ref>http://zoknowsgaming.com/2012/06/17/meet-villains-the-amazing-spider-man-video-game/</ref> headed up by [[Alistair Smythe]] (who used the notes of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]]). The lab rat mutated overnight and bit Whelan, who then developed rat-like symptoms, before retreating to the sewers. When the cross-species go berserk because of sensing Peter Parker\'s Spider DNA, Vermin escapes from its [[Oscorp]] chambers before biting [[Gwen Stacy]] in the shoulder and then escaping Oscorp. Spider-Man eventually finds and chases Vermin through the sewers despite interferences from Alistair Smythe\'s Combat Sentries. Spider-Man eventually defeats Vermin and gets its DNA for Dr. Connors\' antidote.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Vermin_(Edward_Whelan) Vermin] at Marvel.com\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/vermin.html Vermin] at Spiderfan.org\n\n{{Captain America}}\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Ultimate Spider-Man}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vermin (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by J.

ISAAC controls Titan's artificial biosphere environment and all mechanical operations on Titan.  \n\nISAAC observed a conflict between [[Mar-Vell]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and [[Thanos]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #32-35</ref> [[Thanos]] later reprogrammed ISAAC with a virus prior to his death, to menace the Eternals of Titan. The computer enslaved the Titanian Eternals.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #58</ref> ISAAC dispatched Stellarax and Lord Gaea,<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #59</ref> and then [[Elysius]],<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #60</ref> and finally Chaos against Mar-Vell and [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #61</ref> [[Starfox (comics)|Eros]], [[A'lars|Mentor]], and Elyuis eliminated the virus in ISAAC's system, and Mar-Vell defeated Stellarax. The computer was then restored to its original benevolent programming.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #62</ref>\n\nSome time later, ISAAC took on an android form, and allied itself with Stellarax, Chaos, and Lord Gaea, in a renewed attempt to carry out Thanos's will.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> ISAAC then went mad when Mar-Vell forced it to experience the totality of life. ISAAC gave up its android form, and its minions were defeated.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' Vol. 2 #2</ref>\n\nISAAC confers with Mentor when Drax and [[Phyla-Vell|Quasar]] arrive on Titan to consult him, and questions Mentor as he apparently murders them.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #9</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nISAAC is a vast supercomputer which honeycombs the moon of Titan, as well as controls it.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #30</ref> ISAAC has a vast range of computational functions, most of which have not been catalogued. Its power source is the thermal energy found at [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]]'s core. ISAAC is stationary; however, it has been observed to project its holographic representation as far as Earth. This holographic projection takes the form of a humanoid figure in order to facilitate communications with and observation of humanoid life forms.\n\nISAAC has the ability to take an android form, Isaac-Prime, which has superhuman strength, stamina, durability, and reflexes.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/isaactitan.htm|ISAAC}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=3459|title=ISAAC}}\n\n{{Eternals}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Jim Starlin]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike Friedrich]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1973]]\n[[Category:Fictional androids]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Eternals]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"

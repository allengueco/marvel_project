The character first appeared in \'\'[[Strange Tales]]\'\' #126 (November 1964), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].\n\nDebuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], Dormammu has appeared in six decades of Marvel publications, featuring prominently in the [[Doctor Strange]] titles and limited series as a recurring enemy of the [[mysticism|mystic]] hero. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including [[films]], [[animated]] [[television series]], [[toy]]s, [[trading cards]], and [[video games]].\n\nIn 2009, Dormammu was ranked as [[IGN]]\'s 56th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://uk.comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/56.html Dormammu is number 56] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627044842/http://uk.comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/56.html |date=June 27, 2013 }} [[IGN]].

However, the readers were intrigued. They wanted to know more. "It seems there was something about that nutty name, Dormammu, that was keeping Doc\'s devoted disciples awake at nights trying to figure out who Dormammu was," Lee explained. "I knew I was in big trouble. I had made up the name\xe2\x80\x94now I had to dream up a character to go with the name. But who? How?\n\nDitko visualized the answer.

Strange\'s first encounter with Dormammu in the "Dark Dimension" also introduced [[Clea]], eventually revealed to be the niece of the villain (like Clea\'s name, this was not initially revealed in \'\'Strange Tales\'\' #126; November 1964), and the monstrous and imprisoned [[Mindless Ones]].\n\nMajor appearances include starring in an epic fifteen issue storyline in \'\'Strange Tales\'\' #131\xe2\x80\x93146 (April 1965 \xe2\x80\x93 July 1966); the discovery that Dormammu has a sister, [[Umar (comics)|Umar]], and both are in fact mystical beings called \'\'Faltine\'\' in \'\'Strange Tales\'\' #150 (November 1966); teaming with fellow villain [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] to instigate the "Avengers-Defenders War" in \'\'[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\'\' #115\xe2\x80\x93118 (September \xe2\x80\x93 December 1973) and \'\'[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]\'\' #8\xe2\x80\x9311 (September \xe2\x80\x93 December 1973); \'\'[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] \'\' Annual #9 (1981); \'\'Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x932 (November 1988 & January 1989) and the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] \'\'Doctor Strange: The Flight of the Bones\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x934 (February \xe2\x80\x93 May 1999) and \'\'[[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]]\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x933 (September \xe2\x80\x93 November 2000).\n\nAfter a major appearance in \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' #498\xe2\x80\x93500 (October \xe2\x80\x93 December 2003), Dormammu became the patron of small-time villain the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] in \'\'[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]\'\' #46 (December 2008).\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n\n=== 1960s ===\n\n\nDormammu is first mentioned by [[Baron Mordo|Karl Amadeus Mordo]], senior apprentice of the appointed "Sorcerer Supreme" the "[[Ancient One]]", who, in the entity\'s service, attempts to slowly weaken the sorcerer, but is stopped when his fellow pupil [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]] alerts his master to the betrayal.<ref>{{Cite comic\n  | writer= [[Stan Lee]]\n<!--   | artist= [[Steve Ditko]] -->\n  | story= Black Magic\n  | title= [[Strange Tales]]\n  | volume= 1\n  | issue= 111\n  | date= August 1963\n  | publisher= [[Marvel Comics]]\n  | page= \n  | panel= \n}}</ref>\n\nThe character later appears in person when sending a messenger to boast his renewed intentions of conquering his universe before his aging adversary. In response, Doctor Strange travels to Dormammu\'s "Dark Dimension" as the Ancient One does not consider himself powerful enough to defeat Dormammu, and manages to overcome all supernatural servitors sent against him. Dormammu engages Strange in mystic combat and shows himself to be far more powerful, but, when drawing upon the realm\'s energies, inadvertently weakens the barrier containing the horde of [[Mindless Ones]]. Since they threatened Dormammu\'s subjects, Strange helped his enemy to re-seal the juggernauts by letting power from his amulet flow into Dormammu. Indebted to Strange for his help, Dormammu ends the fight, and in return Strange demands a binding vow to never enter the "Earth realm" again and to not harm Clea. Dormammu complies, but gains a burning hatred against Strange for the humiliation.<ref>{{Cite comic\n  | writer= [[Stan Lee]]\n<!--   | artist= [[Steve Ditko]] -->\n  | story= The Domain of the Dread Dormammu!; Duel With the Dread Dormammu!\n  | title= [[Strange Tales]]\n  | volume= 1\n  | issue= 126-127\n  | date= November\xe2\x80\x93December 1964\n  | publisher= [[Marvel Comics]]\n  | page= \n  | panel= \n}}</ref>\n\nDormammu uses a loophole to his oath by granting Mordo vast power, whereupon the sorcerer leads his minions on a lengthy hunt for Strange, and abduct the Ancient One as a bargaining chip. Dormammu\'s niece, [[Clea]], assists Strange by weakening the barrier of the Mindless Ones, forcing her uncle to focus elsewhere. Dormammu learns of her betrayal, brings all three Earth sorcerers to a neutral realm, to let her see his disciple destroy Strange, and summons fellow "Lords of the Netherworlds" to watch the spectacle. When Strange begins to get an advantage against Mordo, Dormammu decides to face the sorcerer in a contest of pure hand-to-hand-combat. The physically stronger entity eventually falls to his foe\'s greater familiarity with [[martial arts]]. To Dormammu\'s humiliation, before the gathered Lords, Strange forces him to vow not to menace the Earth even by proxy.

After imprisoning the horde of marauding virtually unstoppable [[Mindless Ones]], Dormammu enslaved the entire realm and demanded worship as its sole deity.

This version bears little relation to his comic book look aside from the flaming head. He is summoned to Earth by worshipers from [[Grand Cayman Island]]. He plans to stop the [[Moon]] in its orbit when the eclipse occurs so that he can engulf Earth in complete darkness.\n* Dormammu appears in the 1990s \'\'[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]\'\' series\' episodes "Doctor Strange", "Venom Returns", and "Carnage", voiced by [[Ed Gilbert]]. In this series, he uses his servant Baron Mordo to try freeing himself. Knowing that the Venom symbiote was due to reproduce and create a new symbiote, Dormammu had Mordo send the rocket it was on back to earth. Using the newly formed Carnage, Dormammu collected humans souls equal to his own and switched places with them. However, Spidey and Venom manage to reverse the process, sealing Dormammu, Carnage and Venom back into "hot head\'s" home dimension.\n*Dormammu appears in \'\'[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]\'\' episode "Enter: Dormammu", voiced by [[Robert Englund]]. Doctor Strange (whose Eye of Agamotto is holding an Infinity Sword fractal) ends up unleashing Dormammu from his Dark Dimension into Super Hero City. A recurring gag during this episode was Falcon asking Dormammu if he knows that his head is on fire. When Dormammu unleashes his Mindless Ones upon Super Hero City, Dormammu manages to steal the fractals from the Vault and Villainville while taking Captain America and Doctor Doom hostage. When the fractal is extracted from the Eye of Agamotto, Doctor Strange then uses a spell to banish Dormammu back into the Dark Dimension. In "This Al Dente Earth", Doctor Strange briefly pulls Dormammu\'s head out of the Dark Dimension in order to damage Galactus\' machine. In the episode "Soul Stone Picnic", Dark Surfer called up Dormammu where he tells him that he plans to destroy the universe in the next two episodes.\n* Dormammu appeared in the \'\'[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]\'\' episodes "Stranger in a Strange Land"<ref name="Stranger in a Strange Land">{{cite episode|title=Stranger in a Strange Land|series=Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=20|airdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref> and "Hulking Commandos", voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]].\n* Dormammu appeared in the \'\'[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]\'\' episode "Cloak and Dagger", voiced again by Phil LaMarr. Dormammu gains control of [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] so that he can obtain Doctor Strange, Iron Fist, and White Tiger as part of a plot to power the Siege Perilous and lead the Mindless Ones into invading Earth. Dormammu\'s skill with intangibility is featured in this episode. In the episode "The Moon Knight Before Christmas," it was revealed in a flashback that Mysterio made a deal with Dormammu to enhance his illusion abilities where the side-effect ended up trapping Mysterio in his helmet upon his defeat until the day when Spider-Man freed him and his daughter Frances Beck.\n* Dormammu appears in the \'\'[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]\'\' episodes "Widow\'s Run" and "Into the Dark Dimension", voiced again by Phil LaMarr.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Into the Dark Dimension|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=3|number=7|airdate=April 24, 2016}}</ref> Due to the effects that the [[Infinity Gems]] are having on reality, Dormammu and the Mindless Ones emerge from a portal to the Dark Dimension causing the Avengers and Doctor Strange to fight them.

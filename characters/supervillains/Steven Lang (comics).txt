He is a manufacturer of the mutant-hunting robots called [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]]. He first appeared in \'\'[[X-Men]]\'\' #96.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nDr. Steven Lang is a pioneer in the field of robotics and genetic mutation who hates mutants. An employee of the U.S. government, he is placed in charge of a federal investigation into the origin of genetic mutation. He plans to use his talents to create an army of mutant hunting robots to kill all mutants. To this end he seeks to get the government to endorse and financially support his operations. Lang begins by targeting mutant criminals such as [[Mesmero]].{{issue|date=March 2013}} He is backed by [[Edward Buckman|Ned Buckman]] and the "Council of the Chosen,"{{issue|date=March 2013}} the secret group in control of the New York Branch of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] prior to [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]\'s takeover.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nTo defeat his main targets, the X-Men, Lang creates the "X-Sentinels," [[android (robot)|android]] doubles of [[Professor X]] and the original X-Men. However, the X-Sentinels manage only inferior imitations of the X-Men\'s powers, and are easily defeated by the new X-Men. Jean Grey then telekinetically forces Lang to crash his mini-gunship into a wall-screen.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #100 (1976)</ref> He is left in a coma with severe brain damage.{{issue|date=March 2013}} During this time, Lang\'s brain is used as a template for the minds of two sentinels, Conscience and a new [[Master Mold]], both of whom are destroyed in an attempt to release a virus which would have killed all mutants and roughly 97% of normal humans on Earth.<ref>\'\'Marvel Comics Presents\'\' #17-24</ref>\n\nYears later, Lang returns as a member of the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], a group of humans who had been transformed into techno-organic human-alien hybrids.  The transformation process restores Lang\'s mind, and he becomes their leader.{{issue|date=March 2013}}  Lang is the only one of the Phalanx to retain his individual human identity, possibly due to the brain damage; when his true nature is revealed, he was dragged to his apparent death by his lieutenant, [[Cameron Hodge]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nLang\'s corpse is exhumed by the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] and reanimated by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] using a Technarch. He joins a group formed by the foremost anti-mutant leaders under Bastion\'s control.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' vol. 3 #3 (2008)</ref> During the \'\'[[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]]\'\' storyline, Steven Lang, alongside [[Graydon Creed]], is killed by [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]].<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' vol. 3 #28</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs a normal human being Stephen Lang had no superhuman powers.  However, he was a genius and pioneer in the field of robotics, with adequate financial resources to fund his operations. \n\nAs a member of the Phalanx he had all of the characteristics of a techno-organic life form: enhanced strength, durability, and agility, ability to re-shape corporeal form at will, and to infect other beings with the [[techno-organic virus]] and control infected beings.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{X-Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lang, Steven}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1975]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Fictional roboticists]]\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Robot supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]'

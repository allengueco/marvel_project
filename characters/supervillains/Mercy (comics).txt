She can fly/levitate, turn intangible and invisible, or teleport to another area with a thought. She is able to project energy spears, which can inflict damage or drain power. She can shift into different shapes, including a large amorphous lump, which can suffocate a victim, or perfectly mimic the form and personality of another person. In a flashback from the \'\'Hulk: Destruction\'\' mini-series based upon the game of the same name, she turned into a giant super-strong monster, based upon the "Devil Hulk".<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' #458</ref> When her physical form was destroyed by an exploding tanker, she immediately reformed in another location.<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' #458</ref> She can read minds, communicate through telepathy and perform astral projection, and possesses additional extrasensory perceptions enabling her to sense cosmic events of great importance.\n\n==In other media==\n===Video games===\n* Mercy appears in \'\'[[The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction]]\'\', voiced by [[Vanessa Marshall]]. This version appears as the [[bodyguard]] of [[Abomination (comics)|Director Emil Blonsky]] to get rid of gamma-irradiated beings. Mercy has the powers of teleportation, telekinesis, energy manipulation, and levitation. She got her powers from gamma radiation, which was used as treatment that cured her of a brain tumor that would have eventually killed her. During her boss fight, Mercy plans to stop the Hulk from getting the fuel rods, but failed. As Mercy tries to tell the Hulk about her ex-employer\'s current plans, Blonsky kills Mercy as he blows up the building she was in to try to stop the Hulk.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Abigail_Wright_%28Earth-616%29 Mercy] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/mercy/4005-10875/ Mercy] at Comic Vine\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/mercyhulk.htm|Mercy}}\n\n{{Hulk}}\n{{Thunderbolts}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1987]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can turn intangible]]\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics angels]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Todd McFarlane]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Peter David]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]'

He is a nemesis of the superhero [[Moon Knight]].\n\n==Publication History==\nRandall Spector was introduced in the backup feature of ''Hulk! Magazine'' #17 in October, 1979 as a mysterious serial killer known as the Hatchet Man who is murdering nurses around [[New York City]]. Moon Knight attempts to stop the murders, and eventually deduces that the killer is his estranged brother Randall. In #18, Moon Knight confronts his murderous brother in [[Central Park]] and a fight ensues, in which Randall is killed. This was later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] by writer [[Howard Mackie]] to be an impostor and in ''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #33-37 Randall returns. During the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' crossover, writer [[Gregg Hurwitz]] and artist [[Ron Garney]] wrote a three issue limited series where Moon Knight deals with his brother finally.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nRandall Spector and Marc Spector are brothers and have both at certain points been chosen as the avatar of the Egyptian moon god [[Khonsu|Khonshu]]. Randall Spector grew up with his brother Marc from birth, playing army games with him often. He followed his brother into the Marines and eventually both became mercenaries in Northern [[Italy]]. It was later discovered that Randall killed Marc's then nurse girlfriend. Marc hunted his brother down until there was a standoff. Marc threw a grenade into Randall's treetop sniper position, thinking he killed him, but later Randall returns to New York on a killing spree focused on killing nurses with a [[hatchet]]. Moon Knight uses his girlfriend [[List_of_Marvel_Comics_characters:_A#Marlene_Alraune|Marlene]] as bait, but is unable to stop her from getting stabbed. He vows revenge, but is unable to kill his brother. Randall then leaps at Marc, but dodges him; however, Randall stabs himself into a tree branch.<ref>''Hulk Magazine'' 17\xe2\x80\x9318</ref>\n\nIt is later revealed that the person killed wasn't Randall, but an impostor with implanted memories. Randall is actually a member of the Cult of Khonshu, having been mystically enhanced with impenetrable skin and super-human strength by Princess [[Nephthys]].<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #37 </ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, Randall mysteriously resurfaced as the Shadow Knight, convinced by [[Profile (comics)|The Profile]] that he is Khonshu's next [[avatar]] on Earth.<ref>''Shadowland: Moon Knight'' 13</ref> Sharing essentially all of Moon Knight's powers, except that he can emit a radioactive blast from his eyes, the two are almost entirely evenly matched. Randall attacks Moon Knight's pregnant girlfriend, Marlene.<ref>''Shadowland: Moon Knight'' #2</ref> The two eventually meet up in [[New Orleans]] tracking the mysterious Sapphire Crescent. Randall ends up using a hostage as a shield with a bomb and Moon Knight is out of throwing crescents; however, Moon Knight throws the Sapphire Crescent and kills his brother.<ref>''Shadowland: Moon Knight'' #3</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Randall_Spector_(Earth-616) Randall Spector] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Moon Knight}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1979]]"

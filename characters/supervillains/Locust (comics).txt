The character was a one-time [[supervillain]] foe of the [[X-Men]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Locust made his debut in \'\'[[X-Men]]\'\' #24 in September 1966, and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Werner Roth (comics)|Werner Roth]].\n\nThe character subsequently appears in \'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #72 (October 1971), \'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' #194 (December 1975), \'\'X-Factor\'\' #52 (March 1990), and \'\'The Order\'\' #4 (July 2002).\n\nThe Locust received an entry in the \'\'All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z\'\' #6 (2006).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Locust\'s alter ego is [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctor]] August Hopper, once a top name in [[entomology]], whose "crackpot theories" cost him his job. He relocated to Ryan Chemicals, where he developed a Magno-Ray which causes insects to grow to enormous sizes and allows him to control their actions. He sends an army of raging locusts, grasshoppers, wasps, and beetles to overthrow the world, but is eventually thwarted by the X-Men and surrenders to the authorities.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #24</ref>\n\nLocust attacked his daughter\'s fiancee, but was stopped by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' #194</ref>\n\nLocust attacked the original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team, until [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] removed his equipment, leaving him powerless.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' #52</ref>\n\nHe later appears battling [[Doctor Strange]], Hulk, the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], and the [[Silver Surfer]].

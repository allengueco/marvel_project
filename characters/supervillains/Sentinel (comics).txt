They are typically depicted as antagonists to the [[X-Men]]. \n\nThe Sentinels played a large role in the 1990s [[X-Men (TV series)|\'\'X-Men\'\' animated series]] and have been featured in several X-Men [[video game]]s. The Sentinels are featured prominently in the 2014 film \'\'[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]\'\' while [[Danger Room|simulated versions]] made brief appearances in the 2006 film \'\'[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]\'\' and the 2016 film \'\'[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]\'\'. In 2009, The Sentinels was ranked as [[IGN]]\'s 38th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Top 100 Comic Book Villains|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/38.html|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:The X-Men (Uncanny X-Men)-vol.1-14 (November 1965).jpg|thumb|upright|Sentinels\' debut \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]\'\' #14 (November 1965). Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]\nCreated by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], they first appeared in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]\'\' #14 (November 1965).\n\nSentinels are programmed to locate [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] and capture or kill them. Though several types of Sentinels have been introduced, the typical Sentinel is three stories tall, is capable of [[flight]], projects energy blasts, and can detect mutants.\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}\n\nSentinels are designed to hunt [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]. While many are capable of [[tactic (method)|tactical thought]], only a handful are [[self-awareness|self-aware]].\n\nSentinels are technologically advanced, and have exhibited a wide variety of abilities. They are armed (primarily with [[Directed-energy weapon|energy weapons]] and restraining devices), capable of flight, and can detect mutants at long range. They possess vast physical strength, and their bodies are highly resistant to damage. Some are able to alter their physical forms or re-assemble and reactivate themselves after they have been destroyed.\n\nSome Sentinel variants have the ability to learn from their experiences, developing their defenses during an engagement. Several groups of Sentinels have been created and/or led by a single massive Sentinel called [[Master Mold]]. Some Sentinels are also equipped with an inconspicuous logic loop in case they should go rogue to convince them that they are mutants as demonstrated in the Tri-Sentinel.\n\n==Types of Sentinels==\n{{Trivia|section=y|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Sentinels.PNG|thumbnail|250px|Sentinels in \'\'[[Astonishing X-Men]]\'\' vol. 3, #1 (July 2004). Art by [[John Cassaday]].]]\nThere are different types of Sentinels that appear in the comics:\n\n* \'\'\'Mark I\'\'\' and \'\'\'Master Mold\'\'\' - Created by [[Bolivar Trask]]. First appeared in \'\'X-Men\'\' (vol. 1) #14. Bolivar Trask sacrificed himself to destroy the Master Mold.\n* \'\'\'Mark II\'\'\' - Created by [[Larry Trask (comics)|Larry Trask]]. This model was capable of adapting to and counteracting superpowers almost instantly. First appeared in \'\'X-Men\'\' (vol. 1) #57.\n* \'\'\'Composite\'\'\' - Created by merging the remaining portions of five Sentinels destroyed by the X-Men and came under control of Ashley Martin. It was destroyed by her when it rebelled against her.\n* \'\'\'Mark III\'\'\' - Created by [[Steven Lang (comics)|Stephen Lang]] and Project: Armageddon, secretly funded by [[Edward Buckman]] and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Council of the Chosen]]. First appeared in \'\'X-Men\'\' (vol. 1) #98.\n** \'\'\'X-Sentinels\'\'\' - Created by Stephen Lang. They are [[Android (robot)|android]]s who were duplicates of the original X-Men.\n* \'\'\'Mark IV\'\'\' - Created by [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]. First appeared in \'\'X-Men\'\' (vol. 1) #151.\n* \'\'\'Mark V\'\'\' - Created by Sebastian Shaw for U.S. government\'s Project Wideawake. First appeared in \'\'New Mutants\'\' (vol. 1) #2.\n* \'\'\'Mark VI\'\'\' - Created by Shaw Industries for Project Wideawake and used by [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. Also incorporated parts of Project Nimrod.\n* \'\'\'Mark VII\'\'\' - Created by Shaw Industries. They were experimental and remote controlled.\n* \'\'\'[[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]]\'\'\' (later [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]) - A prototype Super Sentinel that arrived from the "[[Days of Future Past]]" timeline and was later reactivated by Reverend [[William Stryker]].\n** \'\'\'Project Nimrod\'\'\' - Created by an offshoot of Project Wideawake and was in the experimental stage. Cancelled after [[X-Force]] interfered. Based on the Nimrod Sentinel.\n* \'\'\'[[Prime Sentinel]]s\'\'\' - Created by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] and \'\'[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]\'\'. They are disabled humans equipped with [[nanotechnology]] without their knowledge at Prospero Clinic. The Prime Sentinels were used as sleeper agents until activated by attack or presence of a mutant.\n* \'\'\'Omega Prime Sentinels\'\'\' - The second generation of [[Prime Sentinel]]s. [[Karima Shapandar]] is one of them.\n* \'\'\'Wild Sentinels\'\'\' - Built in secret by a new Master Mold in Ecuador, activated by Donald Trask III and used by [[Cassandra Nova]]. New units are produced based on the currently available resources \xe2\x80\x93 salvaged parts, weapons and sometimes even entire vehicles \xe2\x80\x93 which give this particular type of Sentinel a very diverse, rag-tag appearance. Due to both this and their design flexibility, a wide variety of different shapes and forms have been observed. The Mega-Sentinels used to destroy [[Genosha]] and Nanosentinels both belong to this kind of Sentinel. The technology used in Nano-Sentinels is also employed by [[Weapon Plus]] for their artificial evolution experiments and the creation of their Super-Sentinels.\n* \'\'\'Mark VIII\'\'\' - Sentinel Squad [[Office of National Emergency|O*N*E]], designed by [[Iron Man|Stark Enterprises]]. Unlike other Sentinels, the Mark VIII requires a human pilot.\n* \'\'\'Bio-Sentinels\'\'\' - Humans infected by a technological virus created by Simon Trask, the victims become anti-mutant activists, who later at Trask\'s command, are fully transformed into robotic Sentinels mindlessly following Trask\'s commands.<ref>\'\'Astonishing X-Men\'\' #31</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n* \'\'\'Stark Sentinels\'\'\' - The Stark Sentinels debuted during the \'\'[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]\'\' storyline. Under the influence of the [[Red Skull]] (who also had erased from him any memory of their construction), [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] created a model of Sentinels based on the knowledge of different super heroes he acquired after the \'\'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\'\' storyline. When Red Skull became the Red Onslaught, and the Avengers arrived to Genosha to stop him, he deployed the Stark Sentinels.<ref>\'\'Avengers & X-Men: AXIS\'\' #1</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Related mutant-hunting creations===\n[[File:Sentinel X-Men Schism Vol 1 1.png|thumbnail|250px|The X-Men battle Sentinels in \'\'X-Men: Schism\'\' #1 (July 2011).

Later revived by The Life Foundation, only to be destroyed again by Spider-Man and [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]. [[Mendel Stromm]] later obtained another one from the bunker of the bankrupt Life Foundation and was later approached by a mysterious benefactor who prepared to give him a Master Mold that specializes in creating Tri-Sentinels.\n* \'\'\'Soviet Sentinels\'\'\' - Created by the Soviet Union and later purchased by Cuban government officials.\'\'<ref>\'\'Mystique\'\' #3-6</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n* \'\'\'Super-Sentinels\'\'\' - Using [[Nanotechnology|Nano-Sentinel technology]], [[Weapon Plus]] created artificially evolved superhumans at \'\'[[Weapon Plus#The World|The World]]\'\'. Three of the creations were chosen to form the mutant-hunting Super-Sentinels: Huntsman, [[Fantomex]] and Ultimaton, who were intended to be presented to the public as superheroes in order to make the extermination of mutantkind look "like a Saturday morning cartoon".\n* \'\'\'Colcord\'s Sentinels\'\'\' - Some of the Boxbots created by [[Madison Jeffries]] (aka Box) to serve the [[Weapon X]] Program, run by [[Malcolm Colcord]]. In one variation of the \'\'[[Days of Future Past]]\'\' timeline seen in the \'\'Weapon X: Days of Future Now\'\' limited series, one of the Boxbots evolves into a new Master Mold and a new breed of Sentinels.\n* \'\'\'Hardaway\'\'\' - A cyborg created at Camp Hayden, killed by the [[Mutant Liberation Front]], who called himself a Bio-Sentinel.\n* \'\'\'X-51 ([[Machine Man]])\'\'\' - Captured by Bastion and "infected" with Prime Sentinel nano-bots which reconfigured and reconstructed his systems thereby giving him similar capabilities to Nimrod, such as adapting to almost any situation and programming that at times forced him to attack mutants.\n* \'\'\'[[Juston Seyfert]]\'s Sentinel\'\'\': First appearing in \'\'[[Sentinel (comic book)|Sentinel]]\'\' #1, this is a rebuilt Sentinel (likely a Mark V or Mark VI), reprogrammed to obey Juston Seyfert.

An [[away team (Star Trek term)|away team]] composed of [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]], [[Deanna Troi]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] encounter an approximation of the "[[Days of Future Past]]" timeline, in which the Sentinels have merged with the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn \'\'[[Ultimate X-Men]]\'\', the Sentinels, created by the [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Bolivar Trask, were already in action at the beginning of the first story arc, hunting down and killing mutants on the streets, in a program apparently openly and publicly acknowledged by the U.S. government. Later on, there were also the \'\'New Sentinels\'\' that were sixty of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]\'s top agents in Sentinel [[powered exoskeleton|battle armor]] that was described as having enough hardware to take on a fleet of the old Sentinel models. A new breed of Sentinel robots, created by Trask under orders from the [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]] twins, was later created.\n\nAfter the events of the [[Ultimatum Wave]], a new model of Sentinel (Nimrod Sentinels) was deployed to hunt, capture or kill mutants that refused to turn themselves in. [[William Stryker|William Stryker, Jr.]] using Sentinel tech, later displayed an ability to summon a fleet of Sentinels after being attacked by the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]].<ref>\'\'Ultimate Comics: X-Men\'\' #3-4</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===What If?===\n* In \'\'[[What If (comics)|What If]]\'\'...

In the episode "A Firestar Is Born", Its seen in a flashback, fighting the X-Men back when [[Firestar (comics)|Firestar]] was a member.\n* The Sentinels appeared a number of times on the [[X-Men (TV series)|\'\'X-Men\'\' animated series]], voiced by [[David Fox (actor)|David Fox]]. They were season one\'s main antagonists. The Sentinels first hunt down [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. The Sentinel program, controlled by [[Bolivar Trask]] and [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], was cancelled but was moved overseas to [[Genosha]]. Trask constructed Master Mold for the Sentinels while on Genosha, but it was apparently destroyed when [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] flooded the complex. Sentinels are later seen in [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]\'s [[Days of Future Past|future timeline]] where they had taken over the world and mutants were on the verge of extinction. In the [[The Final Decision|season one finale]], the Sentinels, acting under Trask\'s orders, rescued [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] from [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], but Master Mold was then "giving the orders now" in Track\'s and Gyrich\'s secret base in the United States. As Master Mold plans to kidnap world leaders from around the world and replace their brains with computers so that the world would fall under its control, the [[X-Men]] managed to fight through a seemingly endless wave of Sentinels until [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] flew the explosive-filled [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] into Master Mold and escaped at the last minute with Magneto\'s help. However, the Sentinels had sporadic appearances in season four.\n* The Sentinels appeared in \'\'[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]\'\'. In the episode "The Mutant Agenda", they are seen in a [[Danger Room]] simulation when [[Spider-Man]] accidentally activated the simulation when visiting the X-Mansion. \n* The Sentinels appear in \'\'[[X-Men: Evolution]]\'\'. This version is much more powerful and heavily armed than their comic book counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} There was originally only a prototype created by former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Bolivar Trask, however, released in public by Magneto to force the X-Men to fight the prototype and reveal mutant existence to the media. The prototype alone was a dangerous challenge, even for the combined might of the X-Men and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]]. Three upgraded models are later used by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] against [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and prove a difficult fight for the ancient mutant. Professor Xavier\'s future visions in the series finale hinted at [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] appearing later in the show\'s timeline leading a fleet of Sentinels.\n* Sentinels appear in the \'\'[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]\'\' animated series, voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]. There are several types: [[Spider-Slayer|Sentinel Prowler]], the Mark I Sentinel, a more futuristic Sentinel, and Sentinel Hounds. The Sentinels are controlled by Master Mold.\n* Sentinels appear in \'\'[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]\'\', voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]. This version were created in an alternate reality\'s future to defend a superhero-less city. They are seen in the episode "Days, Nights and Weekends of Future Past! (Six Against Infinity Part 2)". \n* A Sentinel appeared in a Danger Room simulation in \'\'[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]\'\'.\n* A Sentinel appears in the \'\'[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]\'\' animated series.

Sentinel sketches appear as extras on the [[DVD]] release. The Sentinels\' height was not specified, but the sketches indicated that although their appearance was not severely altered, they would have had the ability to compact itself into a rolling saucer as a mode of transportation.\n* A Sentinel was seen in \'\'[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]\'\' (2006), during a training simulation for the young mutants at Professor Xavier\'s school. At the end of the session, Colossus throws Wolverine at the robot, resulting in its beheading. The Sentinel\'s body is shrouded in fog with the only part ever made visible to the viewer is its severed head. \n* The Sentinels are featured in \'\'[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]\'\' (2014) as secondary threat to the mutants.<ref>{{cite web|author1=CS|title=Mark Millar Talks X-Men: Days of Future Past and Kick-Ass 3|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=99760|website=ComingSoon.net|accessdate=5 November 2017|date=1 February 2013}}</ref> In 1973, Bolivar Trask pitches the Sentinel concept to the US Congress but they decline Trask who then pitches to foreign powers. [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] kills Trask in revenge for the mutant murders that were experimented on during the Sentinels\' conception. Inspired by the fear of Trask\'s death, the US government approves the Sentinel program to hunt and kill mutants, and research on Mystique leads to Sentinels that can adapt to and use mutant powers. The Sentinels eventually expand their targets beyond mutants to baseline humans based on the logic that they have the potential to produce mutant descendants, culminating in a [[Days of Future Past|dystopian future]] where most of humanity and mutantkind have been wiped out. With [[Kitty Pryde]] having developed the ability to project the minds of others into their past selves, the X-Men project Wolverine - the only person capable of surviving the time-travel\'s psychological strain - back into his past self in 1973 to rally the younger versions of Charles Xavier and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to stop Trask\'s assassination, setting into motion the events of the film. The storyline concludes with Mystique defeating Magneto and then deciding not to kill Trask on Xavier\'s encouragement, resulting in the government witnessing clear evidence that not all mutants are a threat to normal humans and deciding to abandon the Sentinel program. The original Sentinels from 1973 were similar in appearance to their comic counterparts being three times the size of a human, possessed gatling guns on one of their arms capable of firing 3000 rounds per minute, sensors that allow them to track carriers of the X-Gene and could fly using the vent-like systems on their chest. They were built out of a space-age polymer to be immune to Magneto\'s powers (but the mutant infuses them with metal bars to control them in the film\'s climax). In contrast, the future Sentinels were smaller and sleeker, with a body built out of adaptive mechanical scales, and besides having Mystique\'s adaptive powers they can reshape their hands into stabbing blades. The Sentinels were designed by [[Legacy Effects]] with [[Digital Domain]] building digital models based on their full-scale practical model while the future variant were all computer graphics made by [[Moving Picture Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/future-threat-x-men-days-of-future-past/|title=Future threat \xe2\x80\x93 X-Men: Days of Future Past|publisher=Fxguide|first=Ian|last=Failes|date=May 27, 2014|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|title=Sentinels: For a Secure Future|location=\'\'X-Men: Days of Future Past\'\' Blu-ray|year=2014|publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|format=Featurette}}</ref>\n* The 1973 Sentinels appear at the end of \'\'[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]\'\' (2016), once again in a training simulation, where the new X-Men team begins their training.\n\n===Video games===\nSentinels have appeared as major antagonists in almost every [[video game]] to feature the X-Men:\n\n* In the [[X-Men (arcade game)|\'\'X-Men\'\' arcade game]], where they served as the bulk of enemies.\n* In \'\'[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade\'s Revenge]]\'\', they were featured enemies in Cyclops\' levels.\n* In \'\'[[X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse]]\'\', Sentinels appear as [[boss (video games)|bosses]] in Genosha, with varying sizes.\n* A robot resembling a Sentinel also appears in both the arcade and SNES versions of \'\'[[Captain America and the Avengers]]\'\'.

They are shown in the background, patrolling the skies of New York City, hunting for mutants.\n* In \'\'[[X-Men: Next Dimension]]\'\', Bastion is the main boss character, who is also unlockable as a playable character. A male Prime Sentinel and a female Prime Sentinel are both available as playable characters.\n* In \'\'[[X-Men Legends]]\'\', they are the game\'s primary antagonists.

Bastion later turns them on the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants. After Bastion is defeated, the Sentinels resume their evacuation duties.\n* In \'\'[[X-Men: The Official Game]]\'\' (which fills the gap between \'\'[[X2 (film)|X2]]\'\' and \'\'[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]\'\'), the Sentinels are part of [[William Stryker]]\'s back-up plan if his plan to eliminate all mutants with the Dark Cerebro failed.

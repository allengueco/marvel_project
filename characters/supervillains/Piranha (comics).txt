After devouring Dorcas's deceased assistants and evolving from a normal fish into a humanoid fish, he ordered other fish into the radiation, creating more Men-Fish. Piranha and his Men-Fish traveled to [[Hydro-Base]] in the hopes of researching more of Dorcas' work there. They followed [[Namor]] and attacked him. During the fight, Piranha was wounded, and his blood attracted his piranhas, which turned on him and devoured him.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #71 (May, 1974)</ref>\n\nThese piranhas who ate the original Piranha evolved into identical versions of the original, eventually numbering in the hundreds. They later captured Namor and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], forcing them to fight to the death. The two combatants instead managed to crush the underwater stadium they fought in and crushed all the Piranhas.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #28 (June, 1977)</ref>\n\nThe original Piranha eventually regenerated, and joined the team [[Deep Six (Marvel Comics)|Deep Six]] alongside Nagala, [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], [[Sea Urchin (comics)|Sea Urchin]], and [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]] while [[Attuma]] had seized the throne of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]]. Deep Six defended Attuma's throne from the invading Prince Namor and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] twice, but lost to the Defenders the second time.<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 2 #7 (September, 2001)</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nAfter ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'', the zombie [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'s head was teleported to the bottom of the ocean along with the [[Zombie (comics)|Zombie]] (Simon Garth). The Deadpool head infected Piranha and all of the Men-Fish with the zombie plague. When the Men-Fish attacked a cruise ship, the new [[Midnight Sons]] arrived and destroyed them. As the Midnight Sons explored the ship, the now zombified Piranha attacked them.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #1</ref> [[Daimon Hellstrom]] causes the ship to explode, destroying all the Men-Fish; Piranha's fate is not shown.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #2</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Piranha was a normal piranha fish mutated by radiation into a semi-humanoid being with human intelligence. The Piranha had superhuman strength, teeth that were strong and sharp enough to penetrate Namor's skin, and the power to command other fish telepathically.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/piranha.htm|Piranha}}\n\n{{Namor}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by George Tuska]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]"

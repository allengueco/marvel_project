The character first appeared in \'\'[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]\'\' #132 (September 1966) and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]].\n\nEgo is portrayed by [[Kurt Russell]] in the film \'\'[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]\'\'.\n\n==Publication history==\nEgo the Living Planet was initially introduced in \'\'[[The Mighty Thor]]\'\' #132 (September 1966), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]].\n\nEgo was created by Kirby during a phase in which he was fascinated with the universe. Ego, the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Kree]], and [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|The Colonizers]] immediately followed the creation of [[Galactus]], thus establishing Marvel Comics\' own "[[space age]] [[mythology]]".<ref>{{cite journal| last=Gartland | first= Mike | title=A Failure to Communicate: Part Two| work= Jack Kirby Collector|number= 22}} Reprinted in {{cite book |title=The Collected Jack Kirby Collector, Volume 5 | first=John, ed.|last=Morrow |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |year=2006 |ISBN=1-893905-57-8 |page=196}}</ref> As Kirby recalled in 1969, shortly after the character\'s debut, Ego\'s genesis came when:\n{{quote|I began to experiment ...and that\'s how Ego came about. ... A planet that was alive; a planet that was intelligent. That was nothing new either because there had been other stories [about] live planets but that\'s not acceptable. ...

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nEgo began absorbing space vessels and even other worlds to survive and gather strength, planning interstellar conquest by producing and sending armies of his anti-bodies across the universe. This behavior attracts the attention of the [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|Rigellian]] Colonizers, who fear that the nearby Ego will consume their home world. They recruit the Thunder God, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], to defeat Ego. Accompanied by a Rigellian [[Analyzer (comics)|Recorder]], Thor encounters Ego, who vows never to leave the Black Galaxy and renounced its plans of conquest, feeling humiliated by his defeat.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #132\xe2\x80\x93133 (Sept.\xe2\x80\x93Oct. 1966). Marvel Comics.</ref> Several months later, a weakened [[Galactus]] invades Ego\'s space and seeks to replenish his energy by consuming Ego. Thor aids Ego in battling Galactus and drives Galactus off. In gratitude, Ego allows its surface to become the new home of the Wanderers, a group of various alien races whose planets had been the very first to be devoured by Galactus billions of years ago.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #160\xe2\x80\x93161 (Jan.\xe2\x80\x93Feb. 1969). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n=== 1970s ===\nThe Rigellian [[Tana Nile]] took a sample of Ego\'s form, in the hope that this could be used to fertilize sterile worlds being considered for habitation.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #201. Marvel Comics.</ref> This act drives Ego insane, and it soon gives in to its primordial urges and absorbs the Wanderers, which causes Thor to side with a returning Galactus. Assisted by ally, [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and Galactus\'s herald, [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]], Thor holds Ego off until Galactus attaches a massive starship engine to Ego\'s south pole, which drives the planet constantly through space and thereby prevents it from being a threat to other planets and populated sections of the universe.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #227\xe2\x80\x93228 (Sept.\xe2\x80\x93Oct. 1977). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n=== 1980s ===\nYears later, Ego gains control of the engine and tracks Galactus to Earth, seeking vengeance.  Unable to locate him, Ego attacks Earth. He causes massive destruction until finally stopped by the [[Fantastic Four]]. Horrified by the devastation, an unknown, reality-altering mutant known as [[The Man with the Power|L.R "Skip" Collins]] undoes the damage caused by Ego as well as all memory of it, excluding the memories of the Fantastic Four as they were off planet at the time, fighting Ego. The superpowered quartet attempted to defeat Ego by removing the power cell from one of the attached, propulsion engines, which the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] attempts to throw into Ego\'s "brain". In response, an angered Ego attempts to counter with his remaining engines but, with one engine now deactivated, the other propels the now-out-of-control planet into the Sun, its gravitational pull breaking apart Ego\'s substance.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #234\xe2\x80\x93235 (Sept.\xe2\x80\x93Oct. 1981). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nEgo, however, slowly reforms from a few surviving particles and repairs the propulsion unit. Ego then digests a number of [[Dire Wraith]]s to replenish its energy reserves, and battles the Spaceknight [[Rom (comics)|Rom]].<ref>\'\'Rom\'\' #69 (Aug. 1985).

While Ego seeks a similar entity to itself, the Stranger has arranged for Alter-Ego to hate Ego, intending to learn through their battle if freedom or captivity breeds a stronger will. Alter-Ego is wounded and loses mass when Ego is forced to attack it in self-defense, but Thor intervenes before Ego can strike a killing blow. The remaining fragments of Alter-Ego become a moon of Ego, and the two begin to travel together as a family.<ref>\'\'Astonishing Thor\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x935 (Nov. 2010{{snd}}July 2011).

Ego attacks Galactus as he journeys to his inner brain at the center of the planet, however loses control of his constructs, which realize that Galactus is not a threat. Ego then reveals that before his creation by the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], his consciousness was that of a man named Egros, similar to Galactus\' former self Galan. After formally meeting one another and putting aside their past animosities, Galactus uses his Life-Bringer abilities to form a body for the rest of Ego, who now calls himself Ego-Prime. Ego-Prime then joins Eternity Watch, a group Galactus has put together to deal with the First Firmament, the first iteration of all that is, who had chained [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].<ref>\'\'The Ultimates 2\'\' #8</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe living planet named Ego has been called a "bioverse". Every part of its substance, including the atmosphere, is alive as much as it is controlled by the consciousness of Ego. It often transforms its surface to appear as a giant face to address powerful beings and can shape its terrain to suit the circumstances. It can use its own substance to extrude tentacles that reach out into space, organic sensors, display plant-like growth, control its own weather to create heavy winds or storms, manipulate the ground to generate earthquakes, volcanoes, geysers, and canyons, and produce virtually endless numbers of non-sentient, humanoid beings from its substance, which it can command across interstellar distances. Ego can also shapeshift its surface into the appearance of a dead world or an idyllic paradise resembling beautiful areas to lure unwary space travelers to its surface. It has various internal features similar to a biological lifeform, like large tunnels that have been compared to arteries, and its consciousness resides in a giant, brain organ deep below its surface. Ego can heat up its internal temperature to burn and destroy life forms inside, has digestive organs to absorb living beings, and an immune system that lets him release powerful antibodies to attack intruders on or below its surface.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Flubb|first= J.A. |title=The Great Kirby Science Fiction Concepts|work=Jack Kirby Collector|number=15|pages= 4\xe2\x80\x939}} Reprinted in {{cite book |title=The Collected Jack Kirby Collector, Volume 3 | first=John, ed.|last=Morrow |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |year=1999 | ISBN= 1-893905-02-0 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eHM3vW6ogDsC&pg=PA132 132\xe2\x80\x93133]}}</ref> It can also control its own radiation and magnetic fields.\n\nEgo can generate vast psionic energies from that rival a hungered [[Galactus]] at their peak.

Marvel Comics.</ref> and communicate to sentient beings using telepathy. If his energy reserves are depleted below a level beyond its ability to replenish, Ego can renew its energy stores by devouring planets, tapping into outside sources like stars, or digesting large numbers of living beings. Its psionic abilities are also how it controls its biosphere.\n\nAdditionally, Ego is exceptionally intelligent, although as its name suggests, it harbors an extreme superiority complex and can be emotional if thwarted. For a while, Ego was propelled through space via the engine Galactus implanted on its south pole, but eventually gained control of it through its vast mental powers, allowing it to travel through hyperspace as vast speeds. However, the device was later removed<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #234\xe2\x80\x93235 (Sept \xe2\x80\x93 Oct 1981).

In the film, Ego is a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] and explains that he came into existence millions of years ago, and has learned to use his cosmic powers to manipulate matter around himself, using this ability to form an entire planet around himself, as well as many resources and a human body to interact with sentient beings. However, being bored of immortality and disappointed with a universe full of inferior life, Ego decides to remake all worlds in the universe into extensions of himself, a plan that requires planted seedlings and the power of another Celestial to activate them. To achieve this, Ego mates with various species until a suitable offspring would be conceived to help put his plan into action. The only suitable child turns out to be Peter Quill, although he rebels and eventually helps destroy Ego when Quill learns that Ego killed Quill\'s mother in order to eliminate the distraction she would have posed to his plan.\n\n===Video games===\n* Ego the Living Planet appears in \'\'[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]\'\', on the game\'s main menu screen.<ref>[http://metro.co.uk/2013/09/11/lego-marvel-super-heroes-preview-and-interview-from-iron-man-to-squirrel-girl-3959229/ "Lego Marvel Super Heroes preview and interview \xe2\x80\x93 from Iron Man to Squirrel Girl"]. \'\'[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]\'\'.

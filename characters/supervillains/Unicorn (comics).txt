Wearing technology designed by the Dynamo, Masaryk gives himself the alias the "Unicorn" and battles [[Iron Man]].<ref>\'\'Tales of Suspense\'\' #56 (Aug. 1964)</ref> The Unicorn was among the villains affected by [[Doctor Doom]]\'s high-frequency emotion charger, who was compelled to attack the [[Fantastic Four]] at the wedding of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]].<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four Annual\'\' #3, 1965; \'\'Marvel: Heroes and Legends\'\', 1996</ref>\n\nThe Unicorn later allies himself with [[Count Nefaria]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #22\xe2\x80\x9323 (July\xe2\x80\x93Aug. 1966)</ref> He then undergoes experimental conditioning to augment his powers. With increased strength, he battles Iron Man once more after attempting to extort money from the U.S. Congress, but he is again defeated.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #4</ref> The process leaves the Unicorn with "accelerated cellular deterioration", and he is taunted with a cure by the villainous [[Red Ghost]] in exchange for help against Iron Man. However, once it becomes evident that the Red Ghost has lied, the Unicorn aids Iron Man and later escapes.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #15\xe2\x80\x9316 (July-Aug. 1969)</ref>\n\nThe villain the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] makes a similar promise to the Unicorn and deploys him against Iron Man. On two more separate occasions, Unicorn\'s battle with Iron Man ends in Unicorn\'s defeat. In the first instance, the Mandarin\'s consciousness becomes entrapped in the Unicorn\'s body,<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #57\xe2\x80\x9358</ref> but the Mandarin\'s mind is later freed from the Unicorn\'s body.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #68\xe2\x80\x9369</ref> Using the alias "The Other", the [[Titanium Man]] uses the Unicorn against Iron Man who is finally able to capture Masaryk. In a dramatic turn, the very moment of his capture sees Masaryk slip into a life-threatening [[coma]].<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #113 (Aug. 1978)</ref> Iron Man takes Masaryk to the [[Avengers Mansion]] where teammate [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] wakes Masaryk and cures him of his debilitating disease. The process has the result of driving Masaryk insane, and a disorientated Unicorn inadvertently activates the hidden robot [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal]]. The Unicorn is stunned by the robot \xe2\x80\x94 which Iron Man drives off \xe2\x80\x94 and then placed in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] pending a cure for his mental illness.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\'  #114 (Sept. 1978)</ref> \n\nMonths later, Masaryk is freed when a fire breaks out at Stark Enterprises.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\'  #145\xe2\x80\x93146 (April-May 1981)</ref> He resumes the identity of the Unicorn and finds and attacks Iron Man once again. Still insane, the Unicorn refuses to believe that "The Other" was a lie, and begins to walk back to the [[Soviet Union]] via the ocean to find him. A severely weakened Iron Man can only watch as the Unicorn apparently drowns in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #154 (Jan. 1982)</ref> \n\nThe Unicorn is later revived by the entity the [[Beyonder]] to fight with a new version of the [[Lethal Legion]]. The Unicorn is given a true third eye on a stalk with energy projection capabilities in lieu of a suit.<ref>\'\'[[Marvel Age]]\'\' Annual #1, 1985</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]\'\' storyline, Unicorn is among the villains recruited by [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]] to help him attack the almost-defenseless Stark Tower.<ref>\'\'Infinity: Heist\'\' #1</ref>\n\n===Yegor Balinov===\nA second unnamed (at the time of his debut) Unicorn with a developed tentacled eye within his power-horn appears as a member of Remont 4 and goes on a rampage in [[St. Petersburg]] until captured by the third [[Titanium Man]]. His third eye is then amputated and he is incarcerated.<ref>\'\'Soviet Super-Soldiers Special Edition\'\' #1 (1992)</ref> \n\nDuring the \'\'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\'\' storyline, the second Unicorn is approached by [[Baron Zemo]] and forced to either join Zemo\'s team of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] or go to jail. He chooses to join and fights on the team\'s behalf.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #104, 2006; #107, 2007</ref>\n\nHe is next seen in \'\'Hulk: Winter Guard\'\' along with [[Iron Maiden (comics)|Iron Maiden]], [[Titanium Man]], Volga, and the Snow Leopards as Remont 6.<ref>\'\'Hulk: Winter Guard\'\', 2010</ref>\n\nThis versions\' real name is revealed to be \'\'\'Yegor Balinov\'\'\' in \'\'[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] A-Z\'\' hardcover vol. 13.<ref>\'\'Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z\'\' #13</ref>\n\n===Aaidan Blomfield===\nA third Unicorn, whose real name is \'\'\'Aaidan Blomfield\'\'\' and wore the same Unicorn costume as his predecessors, only with an actual horn on the helmet, is recruited into the supervillain group \'\'\'Stockpile\'\'\' by [[Morgan Stark]] to destroy Iron Man, but they are defeated by the combined efforts of Iron Man and [[War Machine]]. Blomfield claimed to be an old foe of Iron Man\xe2\x80\x99s, but it is unknown if he really is, or was just riding on the reputation of the original Unicorn. His accent suggests he is either [[Australia]]n or [[Great Britain|British]].<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #330\xe2\x80\x93331 (July-Aug. 1996)</ref>\n\n===Unnamed criminal===\n[[Roderick Kingsley]] later sold one of the Unicorn\'s outfits to an unnamed criminal. Unicorn is seen working for Roderick Kingsley\'s side at the time when [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] (who was actually Roderick Kingsley\'s butler Claude) was leading his forces into attacking the [[Green Goblin|Goblin King]]\'s Goblin Nation.<ref>\'\'Superior Spider-Man\'\' #26</ref>\n\nFollowing Spider-Man\'s victory over the Goblin King, Unicorn was among the former Hobgoblin minions at the Bar with No Name where they encounter [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]].<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' Vol. 3 #1</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]\'\' storyline, Unicorn was among the supervillains that Missile Mate assembled to join the side of [[Phil Urich]] (who was operating as Goblin King) and the remnants of the Goblin Nation upon claiming that Roderick Kingsley "abandoned" them.<ref>\'\'AXIS: Hobgoblin\'\' #2</ref>\n\nRoderick Kingsley later regains Ringer\'s services.<ref>\'\'Spider-Woman\'\' Vol. 6 #13</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nOriginally, the Unicorn had no superhuman powers; his helmet was the source of his abilities. However, the Unicorn has undergone mutagenic radiation treatments which gave him superhuman strength and endurance. The Unicorn\'s soft tissues are dozens of times harder than those of an ordinary human, making him highly resistant to physical injury. The process which endowed the Unicorn with superhuman powers caused accelerated cellular deterioration, which eventually severely affected his sanity and physical health.\n\nHe wears headgear equipped with an energy projector that tunes to various frequency and power levels. This allows him to project concussive energy blasts (electron or neutron beams), lasers, and microwave energy. It also allows him to project a [[force shield|force field]] and to levitate objects magnetically. He also wears a rocket belt equipped with twin, high-efficiency electric micro turbines that allow him to fly; the belt also contains the power supply for his helmet which consists of an array of nuclear-powered thermo-electric cells. The Unicorn also wears body armor of unknown composition.  His equipment was designed by Professor [[Crimson Dynamo#The original Crimson Dynamo|Anton Vanko]].\n\nThe Unicorn is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having received training in armed and unarmed combat by the [[KGB]]. He is highly proficient in the use of firearms. He is highly fluent in both English and Russian, and has received KGB training in intelligence techniques.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of the Unicorn briefly appears as a participant in the abandoned Russian [[supersoldier]] program. This version is one of many convicts found by the [[Ultimates]] in the Tunguska base who were altered using [[biotechnology]] torn from the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], and driven mad by years of isolation. He appears to have the power to project electricity from his horn, to levitate, and enhanced durability. He is killed by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]].<ref>\'\'[[Ultimate Nightmare]]\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x935, August 2004 \xe2\x80\x93 December 2004</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Unicorn appears in the \'\'[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]\'\' episode "Secrets and Lies" voiced by [[Michael Daingerfield]]. He and [[Killer Shrike]] are enforcers for the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. They kidnap Tony Stark, [[Pepper Potts]], and [[Mandarin (comics)|Gene Khan]], in order to send a message to Khan\'s stepfather, Shin Zhang, and the rival Tong gang by boss [[Count Nefaria]]. However, Tony escapes their capture, and defeats the Maggia agents, Killer Shrike, and Unicorn as Iron Man. At the end, Unicorn and Killer Shrike are held captive and tortured by Khan as the Mandarin. The Mandarin later returned Unicorn and Killer Shrike to the Maggia in the episode "Pepper, Interrupted". They again appeared in the episode "Don\'t Worry, Be Happy" in an attempt to rob the Tongs with Quantum Bombs they had acquired from [[Fixer (comics)|Mr. Fix]]. In the episode "Hostile Takeover," Unicorn and Killer Shrike are present as Mr. Fix 2.0 tries to "dissect Iron Man." Killer Shrike and Unicorn then get into a fight which recharges Iron Man until [[Justin Hammer]] breaks up the fight. With a super-speed enhancement to his armor, Unicorn fights Iron Man until he manages to predict where Unicorn is going to pop up and defeats him. In the episode "The Hammer Falls," Killer Shrike and Unicorn are attacked by Justin Hammer in his Titanium Man armor where Justin suspects them of blackmailing. Unicorn is badly injured by [[Titanium Man]]. Iron Man later radios the ambulance to come pick up Unicorn while a pleading Killer Shrike is taken to jail by Iron Man.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvelwiki|Unicorn}}\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/u/unicorn.htm Unicorn at MarvelDirectory.com]\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/stockp.htm#unic|The Stockpile\'s Unicorn}}\n\n{{Iron Man}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1964]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Fictional Russian people]]\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

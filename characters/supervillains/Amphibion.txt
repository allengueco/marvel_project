While he was on the Watcher\'s homeworld he encountered the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] who was also there to get the machine for the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] because he was controlling him.<ref>\'\'Tales to Astonish\'\' #73</ref> The Watcher decided to let them both fight for the machine, and whoever won would get to keep it.

Not knowing they are just there to seek his help, the Hulk attacks and defeats them all. The Empress of the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#S|Sagittarians]], who gathered the Hulk-Hunters, comes down and tells the Hulk about the [[Galaxy Master]] who threatens the entire universe. The Hulk agrees to help and goes into space with them.<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' #269</ref> While on the spaceship, Amphibion explains to the Hulk that since his defeat by him on the Watcher\'s homeworld, he has gone from planet to planet, honing his fighting skills in the hopes of facing him again.

He then asks Banner for help to go back to the Watcher\'s planet to get the Ultimate Machine so that he could use it to bring peace back to his planet. After that they use the Leaders old equipment to transport themselves via "thoughtwaves", but instead of landing on the Watcher\'s planet, they are bounced to a nearby planet.

A hulking albino man with filed teeth, Tombstone is a notorious crime boss in [[New York City]]. He is the father of [[Janice Lincoln]]. He is primarily an enemy of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. He has appeared in various media including two animated series, both \'\'[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]\'\' and \'\'[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]\'\'.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe character was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Alex Saviuk]] and first appeared in \'\'[[Web of Spider-Man]]\'\' #36 (March 1988). The character was immediately established to have a history with longtime Spider-Man [[supporting character]] [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], and was brought on as a regular in \'\'[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]\'\', which was then being written by Conway. Conway explained why he created Tombstone: "My general motivation was a need to work with the characters who weren\'t central to \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' title, since that was the main book. That meant I needed to focus my attention not on [[Aunt May]] or [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]], or even [[J. Jonah Jameson]], but on second- or even third-tier supporting characters. Joe Robertson was one of those. The second motive had to do with my desire to bring back the ruthless gangster [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] had been, but not Hammerhead himself. It just came to me as a character type. One thing led to another, and as his backstory expanded, readers responded well to it."<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 17|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nBorn as Lonnie Thompson Lincoln in [[Harlem]], in [[New York City]], he started out as troubled youth who was bullied by his peers because he was Harlem\'s only [[African American]] [[albino]]. Taller and stronger than the other children, he became a school bully, extorting [[protection money]] from his classmates. The school newspaper, edited by [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], was going to run a story on Lonnie\'s activities, but pulled it when Lonnie used scare tactics to intimidate Robertson. Lonnie allowed his personal demons to direct the course of his life and he turned to a life of serious crime.{{issue|date=December 2017}} As a [[hitman]] and enforcer, he used his albinism to his advantage. He filed his teeth and nails to points, giving him the appearance of a [[vampire]]. This frequently caught his opponents off-guard, making it easier to kill them. He also lifted weights and engaged in many street fights to hone his fighting skills. As an adult, he stood over six feet, seven inches tall.{{issue|date=December 2017}} One night, Robertson, now working for a local paper, went to meet a source only to see the source being killed by Lincoln. He threatened to kill Robertson if the story was brought out. Robertson kept the secret for over twenty years whilst Lincoln became a powerful mob enforcer, killing many others.<ref>\'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #137</ref>\n\nNow known as "Tombstone" on the street, he returned to New York City as the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]\'s hitman.<ref>\'\'Web of Spider-Man\'\' #36</ref> Tombstone threw the [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]] out of the [[Arranger (comics)|Arranger]]\'s window.<ref>\'\'Web of Spider-Man\'\' #38</ref> Tombstone captured a mutant known as the [[Persuader (Marvel Comics)|Persuader]] for the Arranger.<ref>\'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #138</ref> Lonnie returned to Robertson\'s neighborhood. Eventually Robertson went to the police which resulted in Tombstone\'s incarceration, but not before Tombstone confronted and seriously injured Robertson, nearly permanently damaging Robertson\'s spine.<ref>\'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #139</ref> Tombstone then encountered [[Spider-Man]] in Atlanta, Georgia; Tombstone was defeated and sent to the Philadelphia State Penitentiary.<ref>\'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #142</ref>\n\nRobertson was also incarcerated for suppression of evidence. On learning this, Tombstone obtained a transfer to Lewsiburg State Penitentiary where Robertson was incarcerated. In prison, Tombstone killed Robertson\'s befriended bodyguard Bruiser. Tombstone eventually broke out of prison but was confronted by [[Spider-Man]]; he eluded capture after a harrowing battle in which he nearly beat Spider-Man to death before Robertson stopped him. Tombstone and Robertson were knocked into the Susquehana River.  Tombstone brought a badly-injured Robertson to an Amish family so that Robertson could recover enough to give him a decent fight. When Tombstone finally made his move to kill Robertson in retaliation for turning on him during the fight with Spider-Man, Robertson stabbed Tombstone with a pitchfork and then escaped. Tombstone joined a criminal organization, headed by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], and then saved Robertson from Hobgoblin so that he could kill Robertson himself.<ref>\'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #150, 153, 155, 157, 161</ref> Robertson was then given a full pardon for helping recapture Tombstone.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nTombstone eventually gained a [[superhuman]] physical constitution. Tombstone encountered Robertson at the Osborn Chemical Plant. Robertson shot Tombstone and trapped him in an airtight test chamber which contained an experimental gas. The gas was absorbed into Tombstone\'s bloodstream and had a mutagenic effect on his body, enhancing his strength and heightening his other physical abilities. Tombstone then called off his vendetta against Robertson in gratitude.<ref>\'\'Web of Spider-Man\'\' #66-68</ref> Tombstone was later defeated by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Punisher]] while competing against the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] in a real game of [[Assassin (game)|Assassin]] sponsored by the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #292-293</ref>\n\nTombstone was hired by the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] to be part of the Spider-Man killing group, the [[Sinister Twelve]], but was defeated.<ref>\'\'Marvel Knights Spider-Man\'\' #10-11</ref>\n\nTombstone was hired by [[Lily Lucca]] to pretend he kidnapped Lily and to fight Daredevil, but Tombstone was beaten by Daredevil.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' vol. 2 #90-91</ref>\n\nTombstone joined the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]\'s army of criminals.<ref>\'\'Punisher (2009)\'\' #4</ref> He later returned to pester [[Deadpool]] in the miniseries: \'\'Deadpool - Suicide Kings\'\'.{{issue|date=December 2017}}\n\nTombstone was with the Hood when he presents the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]\'s costume to whichever low-level crook impresses him until the party is crashed by the [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|Scorpion]] stealing the costume.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #626</ref>\n\nDuring the "Origin of the Species" storyline, [[Doctor Octopus]] invites Tombstone to join a supervillain team in exchange for some items.

He possesses physical strength that has been increased beyond his original limits to superhuman levels. Tombstone\'s body is highly resistant to physical injury and is capable of withstanding extreme temperatures, great impact forces, high caliber bullets and toxic gases without sustaining injury. His reflexes, speed, and stamina are likewise heightened beyond a range attainable for normal human beings.\n\nAside from these advantages, he is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with years of street fighting experience and, even before gaining powers, was easily capable of killing someone with his bare hands. He now combines his street-fighting skills with his superhuman strength to create a unique fighting style. He is also highly proficient with conventional firearms and well connected in the underworld of organized crime.\n\nAs an albino, Tombstone is sensitive to sunlight due to a natural deficiency of [[melanin]]. He is usually depicted as only being capable of speaking in whispers. However, after the exposure to gas at OsCorp, he has been depicted speaking in tones approaching normal vocal tones.\n\nTombstone has filed all his teeth into razor-sharp points.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===MC2===\nAn older version of Tombstone appears in the \'\'Spectacular Spider-Girl\'\' digital comic series, set in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe. He had been paid by [[Silvermane]] to carry out a hit on [[Spider-Girl]]. Despite his advanced years, Tombstone still proved to be a tough opponent to defeat.<ref>http://marvel.com/digitalcomics/titles/Spectacular_Spider-Girl.2009.3</ref>\n\nHe met Spider-Girl and did battle with her, but when he saw another Spider-Girl saving people from a burning building on TV Tombstone grew furious and rapidly finished her off. {{Issue|date=July 2009}}\n\nWhen Tombstone met the Blue Spider-Girl, he revealed to her that he killed the other Spider-Girl, which caused her to attack him in rage. Tombstone was surprised that she has symbiote powers and was defeated. At first thinking he will be on the streets again soon since he believes heroes cannot kill, the Blue Spider-Girl suffocates and kills him. {{Issue|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Marvel Noir===\nTombstone appears in \'\'[[Luke Cage Noir]]\'\'.<ref>\'\'Luke Cage Noir\'\' # 1</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| footer = Tombstone as seen in \'\'[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]\'\' (top) and in \'\'[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]\'\' (bottom). \n| image1 = TombstoneTabletofTime.jpg\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| image2 = TombstoneSpectacularSpiderMan2.png\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n}}\n* Tombstone/Lonnie Lincoln appeared in \'\'[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]\'\', voiced by [[Dorian Harewood]].<ref name="BTVA">https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Spider-Man/Tombstone/</ref> This version was disfigured in the same laboratory accident responsible for his superpowers, blaming former child-hood friend [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] for the accident. Tombstone\'s revenge attempts on his former friend put him in regular conflict with [[Spider-Man]] while under the employ of various crime figures like [[Silvermane]] and [[Richard Fisk]]. \n* Tombstone/L. Thompson Lincoln appears in \'\'[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]\'\', voiced by [[Keith David]] in the [[Survival of the Fittest (The Spectacular Spider-Man)|pilot episode]] and by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in later episodes.<ref name="BTVA"/> This version is depicted as a calculating and intelligent [[Boss (crime)|crime lord]] known as the "\'\'\'[[Big Man (comics)|Big Man]]\'\'\'" of crime with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] as a henchman yet has the public image of a benevolent wealthy [[philanthropist]]. In the pilot, he has Hammerhead hire the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] to take out Spider-Man. He later enlists [[Norman Osborn]] to create super-villains, resulting in the creation of [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]. A gang war later breaks out between him, [[Doctor Octopus]] and Silvermane over control of New York\'s underworld, culminating in a summit where Hammerhead pits the three crime lords against each other. After a lengthy battle, he is defeated and exposed by Spider-Man and then discovers that his Big Man position has been taken over by the Green Goblin.\n\n===Video games===\n* Tombstone appears in \'\'[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]\'\', voiced by [[Nolan North]].<ref name="BTVA"/>\n* Tombstone appears as a side mission [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] in the 2018 \'\'[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]\'\' video game, voiced by Corey Jones.<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/7/17819416/spider-man-ps4-villains-guide</ref> This version is a bald-headed, powerful, and well-known drug lord and biker gang leader in [[New York City]] who was exposed to a chemical in his youth that hardened and turned his skin white, also eliminating his sense of pain and thus causing him to consider himself "immortal." During her investigation into the Inner Demons gang led by [[Mister Negative|Martin Li]], [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] discovers that Tombstone and his crew are building some sort of armored vehicle for the Inner Demons. In a side mission, Spider-Man finds his hideout and engages him and his henchmen in a fight. Despite Tombstone\'s brute force and fighting skills, Spider-Man is able to deploy a drug meant to fix Tombstone\'s condition, thus making him vulnerable enough to bleed and feel pain. Spider-Man is eventually victorious and as he leaves him for the police, Tombstone realizes that being "mortal" makes his life of crime more exciting and states that he can\'t wait for a rematch with Spider-Man.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Tombstone Tombstone] at Marvel.com\n* [https://archive.is/20130109015650/http://worldofblackheroes.com/2011/05/28/tombstone-%E2%80%93-lonnie-thompson-lincoln/ World of Black Heroes: Tombstone Biography]\n\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Black Cat}}\n{{Sinister Six}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tombstone (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gerry Conway]]\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with albinism]]\n[[Category:Fictional crime bosses]]\n[[Category:Fictional mobsters]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of bullies]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]'

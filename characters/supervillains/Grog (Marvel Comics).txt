The character is depicted as a member of the [[Heliopolis (comics)|Heliopolitan]] race of gods.\n\n==Publication history==\nGrog first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #390 (April 1988), and was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]].\n\nThe character subsequently appears in ''Thor'' #396-400 (October 1988-February 1989). His final appearance was in ''Thor'' Annual Vol 3 1 (1990).\n\nGrog the God-Slayer received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #3.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nA loyal follower of the Egyptian God of death, [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]], Grog led his armies to assassinate the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] God of Thunder, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] after his return to Earth. On the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' floating headquarters called [[Hydro-Base]], Grog, and a horde of soldiers, made their first strike. Thor was aided by his comrades, the [[Captain America|Captain]] and the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], and the three of them managed to defeat Grog and all of Seth\xe2\x80\x99s men. Grog was carted off to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] by the Black Knight, but he would soon be free again.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nAfter a second attempt, by Seth, to take the life of Thor by creating a group of super humans called [[Earth Force (Marvel Comics)|Earth Force]], Thor went to the Vault to question Grog of his master\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\nNot alone, Thor traveled with fellow [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardian]] [[Hogun]], the Grim, the Black Knight, and the reformed Earth Force, but Grog was not intimidated by the forces that massed against him. Once freed from his shackles, Grog summoned a portal back to the territory of Seth and escaped his foes. Thor had planned on Grog's escape in order to follow him into the realm of death so he could face the Death god, but Grog had been ready for Thor and his allies by having a welcoming party ready to greet his enemies once they were through the portal. The heroes fought valiantly, but were ultimately overwhelmed by Seth\xe2\x80\x99s troops. Thor, too, fell before his enemies when [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], the Brave, summoned Thor\xe2\x80\x99s powers back to Asgard to help defend the Golden City against another wave of Seth\xe2\x80\x99s unrelenting attack. Grog reveled in his triumph over the Thunder god.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe victory was short-lived, however, because with the seeming death of Balder came the return of Thor\xe2\x80\x99s powers. Thor wasted no time in dispatching his foe and damaging the stronghold of Seth, the Black Pyramid. Grog, now bound and at the mercy of his captors, knew the fortress better than his enemies and got away using a secret door in the pyramid\xe2\x80\x99s corridors. However, he soon returned with reinforcements to crush Thor once and for all. His strategy did not go as planned for the combined might of the Asgardians, Earth Force, the Black Knight, and the other Egyptian gods proved to be too much for Grog and his men. Unwilling to admit defeat, Grog resurfaced for the final time as [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]], the fire demon, battled Thor. He shouted boasts of his recovery and his opponents\xe2\x80\x99 inevitable defeat, but it was he who met his demise when Surtur used the remains of the Black Pyramid as a weapon against the mighty Thor. Throwing the citadel at Thor, the Black Pyramid was destroyed by Thor's mallet, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], leaving Grog and his remaining forces to be crushed inside.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nGrog was later sent to Earth by Seth with Gog, Magog and Scarab to hunt down an emotionally battered Thor, who just killed his grandfather [[Borr]]. The villains were supposed to report the location of Thor, but Grog thought he could take advantage of the weakened Thor. Thor was able to defeat Grog and as punishment Seth severed Grog's hand.<ref>''Thor Annual'' Vol 3 1</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Grog Grog] at the Marvel Comics wiki\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Ron Frenz]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Heliopolitans]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Mythology in Marvel Comics]]"

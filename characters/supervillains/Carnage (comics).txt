The character belongs to a race of amorphous [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Parasitism|parasites]] known as the [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiotes]]. He is usually depicted as an adversary to [[Spider-Man]], as well as serving as the archenemy of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. The symbiote has taken many hosts. The original and most notable host from [[Earth-616]] is \'\'\'[[Cletus Kasady]]\'\'\', a serial killer from the Marvel Universe. [[Norman Osborn]] and his grandson [[Normie Osborn]] have also used the symbiote and have been referred to as the \'\'\'Red Goblin\'\'\'. \n\nIn 2009, Carnage was ranked as [[IGN]]\'s 90th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/90.html|title=Carnage is number 90|work=Comics|publisher=[[IGN]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715065142/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/90.html|archivedate=2013-07-15 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nWriter [[David Michelinie]] created Carnage because he wanted to make a darker version of [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]],<ref name="SM: Carnage">\'\'Spider-Man: Carnage\'\'</ref> intending to have Venom\'s human alter ego, [[Eddie Brock]], be killed off in \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #400 and have the symbiote continue to bond with a series of hosts. However, as Brock and Venom\'s popularity increased, Marvel would not allow him to be killed. Michelinie decided to create a new character: a total psychopath who, unlike Venom, had no sense of morality. The character was originally meant to be named "Chaos"<ref name="Wizard">\'\'[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]\'\' Spider-Man Special, pg. 45</ref> and then "Ravage" before being settled on "Carnage". Carnage\'s human component, Cletus Kasady, was designed by artist [[Erik Larsen]], who modeled the character after the [[DC Comics]] supervillain [[Joker (character)|the Joker]].<ref name="Cletus Kasady question">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=27774 |title=Cletus Kasady (question for Erik) (one post from a messageboard thread) |accessdate=2007-06-24 |author=Erik Larsen |date=2007-03-27 |publisher=Image Comics Community |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210624/http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=27774 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}</ref> [[Mark Bagley]] designed the Carnage symbiote.\n\n[[Cletus Kasady]] was introduced in \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #344 and first appears as Carnage in issue #361.<ref>{{cite book|last = Cowsill|first = Alan|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 197|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Artist Mark Bagley\'s era of \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' hit its stride as Carnage revealed the true face of his evil.

The new symbiote then bonded with Brock\xe2\x80\x99s cellmate [[Cletus Kasady]], transforming him into Carnage.<ref name="ASM 344-345">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #344\xe2\x80\x93345</ref>  The bond between the Carnage symbiote and Kasady was stronger than the bond between Brock and the Venom symbiote. As a result, Carnage is far more violent, powerful, and deadly than Venom.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> He escaped prison,<ref name="ASM 359">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #359</ref> and began a series of murders, and at the scene of each crime, wrote "Carnage" on the walls with his own blood. He was found by [[Spider-Man]] in Kasady\'s old orphanage, but Spider-Man proved to be no match for Carnage\'s powers and uncontrollable rage. In desperation, Spider-Man made a truce with Venom to fight Carnage.<ref name="ASM 361">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #361</ref> The Carnage symbiote was defeated and apparently destroyed with [[sonic weapon]]ry, but unbeknownst to them the symbiote\xe2\x80\x99s deeper equilibrium with its host helped to save it. After entering Kasady\xe2\x80\x99s body through a small cut, it bonded to his blood (which caused its red coloration).<ref name="Max Carnage">\'\'\'\'\'Maximum Carnage\'\'\'\'\': \'\'Spider-Man Unlimited\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x932; \'\'Web of Spider-Man\'\' #101\xe2\x80\x93103; \'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #378\xe2\x80\x93380; \'\'Spider-Man\'\' #35\xe2\x80\x9337; \'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #201\xe2\x80\x93203</ref>\n\n===Venom vs. Carnage=== \nWhen a videogame is created starring Carnage, the Carnage symbiote breaks out of confinement by somehow going through the computer monitor. After causing havok at Ravencroft he attacks Venom, who manages to defeat him and return him to Ravencroft Institute.<ref name="Venom #1-4">Venom #1-4</ref>\n\n===Bonding with John Jameson===\n{{Main|John Jameson (comics)}} \nThough bonded to Kasady\'s bloodstream the symbiote found a way to ditch its host by travelling through the Ravencroft Institute\'s water pipes overwhelming Ravencroft\'s chief, John Jameson. Carnage used him to commit further murders before eventually bonding with Spider-man, who was Ben Reilly at the time.<ref name="Spider-Carnage"/>\n\n===Spider-Carnage===\n{{Main|Ben Reilly}} \nIt eventually transferred itself to Spider-Man\xe2\x80\x94[[Ben Reilly]] at the time\xe2\x80\x94when Ben bonded with it in order to prevent it from hurting any innocent people, creating Spider-Carnage. Ben\'s willpower held out against the symbiote\'s murderous desires long enough for him to return it to Ravencroft. Reilly subsequently attempted to destroy the symbiote by subjecting himself to a potentially lethal blast of microwaves, but it escaped back to Kasady after the microwaves forced it to separate from him.<ref name="Spider-Carnage">\'\'Sensational Spider-Man\'\' #3, \'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #410, \'\'Spider-Man\'\' #67, and \'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #233</ref>\n\n===Carnage Cosmic===\n{{Main|Silver Surfer}} \nDuring a subsequent rampage, the Carnage symbiote briefly attempted to take control of the [[Silver Surfer]], who was visiting Earth at the time to welcome the [[Fantastic Four]] after their return to life following the battle with [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. As it turned out, [[Galactus]] had consumed a planet that many Symbiotes lived on, and the species had made it a race memory so that each future Symbiote could remember it, as well as the Surfer who had been Galactus\'s herald at the time. Upon seeing the Silver Surfer, the Carnage Symbiote abandoned Kasady and bonded with the Silver Surfer, becoming the Carnage Cosmic. Spider-Man and the Surfer managed to return the Symbiote to Kasady, who was dying from stomach cancer, and then the Silver Surfer proceeded to seal both host and Symbiote in an unbreakable prison in an attempt to force him to reflect on his sins for eternity.<ref name="ASM 430-431">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #430\xe2\x80\x93431</ref>\n\n===Venom Victorious=== \nHaving tracked Kasady to a prison specially designed to hold him, Venom eventually reabsorbs the Carnage symbiote into his own body "for good" by eating it.\n\n===Symbiotic Resurrection=== \nKasady escaped from prison and was chased by Spider-Man before the two were sucked into the [[Negative Zone]]. Spider-Man teams up with a Negative Zone hero named [[Dusk (comics)]] while Kasady teamed up with a villain named [[Blaastar]] who was bent on destroying the world. While in the Negative Zone, Kasady found another Symbiote who he bonded with, which allowed the few remains of the Carnage symbiote inside of Cletus to absorb it and resurrect itself in the process to once again become Carnage.<ref name="Web-Spinners 14">\'\'Web-Spinners\'\' #14</ref>\n\n===Toxin===\n{{Main|Toxin (comics)}} \nEventually, the Carnage symbiote reproduces, with Kasady implanting a spawn of it into Patrick "Paddy" Mulligan, an Irish-American police officer who was recently married and expecting a child. Mulligan became [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]]\xe2\x80\x94who single-handedly overpowered both Venom and Carnage. Nevertheless, Mulligan remained determined to use \'\'his\'\' new-found powers for good\xe2\x80\x94learning as much as he can from Spider-Man\xe2\x80\x94while leaving behind his wife and newborn son in order to protect them from danger.<ref name="Venom v Carnage 1-4">\'\'Venom vs. Carnage\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x934</ref>\n\n===Breakout===\nCarnage is one of several [[supervillain]]s trying to escape from The Raft.<ref name="The Avengers 1-2">\'\'[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x932</ref> [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] flies Carnage outside the [[Earth]]\'s [[atmosphere]] and rips him in two.\n\n===Family Feud===\nIt is later discovered that, although the host was presumably killed, the symbiote survived by becoming dormant and returned to Earth. The [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] return, hoping to repair the symbiote.<ref name= "Carnage">\'\'Carnage\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x935</ref> Using the properties of the symbiote, Michael Hall, a competitor of Tony Stark, creates prosthetic limbs and exo-suits which respond in the same ways as a symbiote. One such person, Dr. Tanis Nieves, is outfitted with one of these prosthetic arms after she is caught in an attack by the Doppelganger. When near the symbiote, her arm goes wild and forces her to kill several scientists before the symbiote forcefully bonds to her, becoming the new Carnage.<ref name="Carnage" /> After the symbiote uses Tanis to break into a Hall Corporation facility, it is revealed that Kasady is alive (although both of his legs have been severed), his body preserved by the symbiote and repaired by Hall\'s prosthetics.<ref name="Carnage"/> Kasady reclaims the symbiote and becomes Carnage once more, attempting to avenge his captivity while Spider-Man and [[Iron Man]] struggle to stop him. It is then revealed that Carnage is once again pregnant, and the suit\'s spawn briefly bonds to Shriek before being torn from her. Scared of Shriek\'s malice, the symbiote arm then bonds to Tanis, creating a new hero, Scorn, who defeats Shriek and forces her to use her sonic shriek to weaken Carnage for Spider-Man and Iron Man. Carnage, however, escapes with the Doppelganger and swears to make a bloody comeback.<ref name="Carnage" />\n\n===Carnage USA===\nIn the aftermath of his return, Carnage sets off west to Doverton, Colorado.<ref>http://marvel.com/news/story/16101/carnage_usa #1.</ref> He bonds most of the town to copies of his symbiote. [[Captain America]], Spider-Man, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] attempt to defeat him but all except Spider-Man are bonded to copies. With the Avengers team compromised and Spider-Man out of communication, they send in another team consisted of symbiote-enhanced special forces. Dr. Tanis Nieves as Scorn goes along with the separated parts of Hybrid which make up Agony, Phage, Riot, and Lasher, but they are heavily outnumbered since Carnage controls the entire town. Captain America breaks free of his hold long enough to make an emergency call for back up to none other than Venom. [[Flash Thompson]] in the Venom symbiote  sets off to Colorado to kill Carnage. The enhanced special forces keep fighting but Carnage sends the controlled Avengers after them, that was when Spider-Man comes with the unaffected residents of the town. The melee is particularly fierce when Venom intervenes with sonic rounds. Venom is about to kill Carnage with a gun in the mouth but Spider-Man stops him. Before Venom or Carnage can recover, Scorn uses a construction vehicle to carry the two to a device she built. She reveals that her device is meant to permanently remove the bonds from Carnage and Venom, but the hosts are still in there, leaving Kasady alone with a legless Flash Thompson. After the symbiotes fighting with themselves and the Avengers team, Venom finds its way back to Flash Thompson while Scorn is able to capture and contain the Carnage symbiote. The series ends with Kasady being captured and dragged into the back of a prison vehicle.<ref>\'\'Carnage USA\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x935</ref>\n\n===Minimum Carnage===\nCarnage escapes prison yet again with the help of microns. Agent Venom is sent to the prison and discovers Kasady has escaped. Carnage flees to Houston, Texas and causes havoc, attracting the attention of the [[Scarlet Spider]]. Carnage takes the scientist Dr. Ketola, an expert in inter-dimensional transportation, as a hostage and escapes into the Microverse.<ref>\'\'Minimum Carnage Alpha\'\'</ref> He is defeated by Venom and Scarlet Spider, who use a sonic bomb from the Microverse to temporarily separate Kasady from the symbiote. Scarlet Spider then impales Kasady through the eye, lobotomizing him. Carnage goes into a catatonic state: The symbiote is keeping his body alive, similar to a life-support system, but Kasady\'s brain and mind are believed to be irreparably damaged, leaving the symbiote in control.<ref>\'\'Minimum Carnage Omega\'\'</ref>\n\n===Superior Carnage===\n{{Main|Karl Malus}} \nKasady, now lobotomized, later broken out of prison by the [[Wizard (comics)|Wizard]] and [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], who intend to recruit him into the Frightful Four and turn him into their own version of Venom. Carnage breaks free from Wizard\'s control and nearly kills him, but is subdued by Klaw. Taking Carnage into their hideout, Wizard tries to take control of Kasady\'s mind, but fails due to it being too damaged. Wizard then transfers the Symbiote to Dr. [[Karl Malus]]. Dr. Malus was enraged and under the influences of the Symbiote tried to kill his teammates, but he was subdued by Klaw and controlled by Wizard, who renames him "Superior Carnage" and equips him with weapons.<ref name = "SupCar">\'\'Superior Carnage\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x935</ref>\n\nMalus tells Klaw not to be fooled as while he is forced to obey the Wizard, if his control slips the Symbiote will take control and turn against them. After taking all the weapons and starting to move to the city hall, Wizard blows up the hideout with Kasady still inside, seemingly killing him. While storming the city hall, Superior Carnage states that Kasady was a fool who wasted so much time on chaos while there was much more to be accomplished with a little focus. However, when Wizard\'s control slips for a moment Carnage begins to revert to his original form until Wizard regains himself.<ref name = "SupCar"/>\n\nThe trio are confronted by the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] and during their battle the Wizard loses his control over Carnage and he is fatally injured once Spider-Man accidentally drops him due to the shock of finding out Wizard read his mind and knows about Otto Octvaius. Carnage, now free, goes on a rampage and starts to kill anyone in front of him. Klaw tries to stop him, but due to his weapon being damaged he fails and realizes that the only way is for the Wizard to take back control. Both Carnage and Klaw make their way outside. Carnage fights the Superior Spider-Man and admits that although he liked using weapons, for him ripping and slashing the bodies is better. Klaw tries to get the Wizard to control Carnage again, but is killed by Carnage and the explosion separates the Symbiote from its host, only to bond with the injured Wizard. Ultimately, Spider-Man brings out Kasady\'s body to successfully draw the symbiote into it, which immediately devours Dr. Malus and then prepares to finish off the Wizard. However, Klaw ephemeral spirit focuses his sound manipulation powers one last time for a split second to create a powerful sonic blast that disables Carnage, allowing the symbiote to be recaptured. In the epilogue it is shown that the symbiote has managed to repair the Wizard\'s and Kasady\'s brain damage, followed by Kasady writing "CARNAGE RULES" on his cell wall.<ref name = "SupCar"/>\n\nA piece of the symbiote (which had died in captivity) escapes containment and sets out in search of Kasady, who is bedridden due to having been stabbed by a fellow prison inmate. A doctor, anticipating that the symbiote will come seeking Kasady, smothers the killer in the infirmary, wanting the alien for himself. When the symbiote breaks into the facility, the doctor offers himself to the creature, but it rejects him, and returns to Kasady after resuscitating him. Carnage proceeds to asphyxiate the doctor, rampage through the prison, and escape.<ref name = "SCA">{{Cite comic| writer = [[Cullen Bunn]]| penciller = Kim Jacinto and Mike Henderson| inker = Kim Jacinto and Mike Henderson| story = | title = Superior Carnage Annual| volume = 1| issue = #1| date = 5 February 2014| publisher = Marvel Comics| location = United States| page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>\n\n===Deadpool vs. Carnage===\nMuch later, Carnage clashed with [[Deadpool]] believing it was his own destiny to hunt Carnage.<ref>\'\'Deadpool vs. Carnage\'\' Vol. 1 #1</ref> When Carnage tore Deadpool to pieces, Deadpool bonded with the four symbiotes Phage, Riot, Lasher, and Agony.<ref>\'\'Deadpool vs. Carnage\'\' Vol. 1 #3</ref> Bonded with the four symbiotes, Deadpool tricked Shriek into thinking she killed Carnage.

Kasady left a message signaling his return in the form of murdering a random bystander whom he had asked where to find the boy as proof that he was reverted to his more natural moral axis.<ref>\'\'Nova\'\' (vol 5) #25</ref>\n\nAfter learning that Sam\'s mother works at a local diner, Kasady took her hostage there in order to get his attention, but, tired of waiting, Kasady decided to kill her. Nova arrived before he could do so and took him away from the diner to an empty area in order not to hurt anyone. While fighting, Nova tried to convince him that he wasn\'t Sam Alexander, but the maniac didn\'t believe him. After being wounded by the Nova Force, Kasady fled in order to let his symbiote heal him as the police arrived. In the next day, already healed from his burns, Kasady attacked Sam again, this time at his school.<ref>\'\'Nova\'\' (vol 5) #26</ref>\n\nWhile attacking Sam at school, Carnage saw Nova flying around the area, thus making it impossible for the boy to be Nova (unbeknownst to him, that was Sam\'s mother wearing his helmet). Enraged, Carnage followed the false Nova, but lost sight of her. He then started to attack innocent people to try to get Nova\'s attention, which he got. A new battle ensued between them both. Carnage was taken by Nova to the sky and then punched him into the parking lot below, the impact setting off the cars\' alarms, dizzying Kasady and his symbiote. Kasady was then thrown by Nova, who had already realized Carnage\'s weakness to high sounds, into an [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] (a heavy metal band which Kasady was a fan of) show nearby. As the symbiote screamed in pain, Kasady fled from there to the road, but was attacked by Nova again. He threw a car at Nova, who caught it midair, and took advantage of it to punch him. Ready to finish off his opponent, Carnage was hit by a truck. He was then tied in metal plates by Nova and left by his symbiote as he revealed he wanted to kill Nova because he wanted to erase any memory of his good deeds, from the time he had his moral axis inverted, from anyone who remembered it. He was left by Sam in Ryker\'s Island.<ref>\'\'Nova\'\' (vol 5) #27</ref>\n\n===Red Goblin===\n{{Main|Norman Osborn|Normie Osborn}}\nFollowing [[Secret Empire (comics)|Hydra\'s coup of America]], the Carnage symbiote was stolen from an old S.H.I.E.L.D. storehouse by the then-powerless [[Norman Osborn]].<ref name="ASM 794">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #794</ref> He initially found himself overwhelmed by the symbiote\'s desire for mindless slaughter when he allowed it to merge with him,<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #795</ref> but he has been able to \'persuade\' the symbiote to let him take control of Carnage\'s powers to show it something other than \'boring\' mindless slaughter.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #796</ref> Using this combination of powers during the "Go Down Swinging" storyline, Norman is easily able to tear through Human Torch, [[Clash (comics)|Clash]], [[Silk (comics)|Silk]], [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]], and Agent Anti-Venom, with the combination of the symbiote and the Goblin serum rendering Carnage immune to its traditional weaknesses, eventually transferring part of the symbiote to his grandson Normie enough to turn him into a miniature version of Red Goblin.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #799</ref> The Carnage symbiote is seemingly destroyed by Spider-Man when he hits it with an exploding gas tank, however, because the symbiote was attached to Norman when Peter destroyed it, he wonders what sort of effect that might have had on his old foe\'s mind. Later as Spider-Man visits Norman in Ravencroft, it\'s revealed that Norman\'s mind appears to have been completely fried and now believes that Spider-Man is actually Norman Osborn and he is Cletus Kassidy. It\'s not clear whether or not he\'s faking it or if he had actually lost his mind. Meanwhile, Harry manages to remove the Carnage symbiote from Normie. Not all of it has gone.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #800</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Main article|Symbiote (comics)}}\nAs Eddie Brock explained,<ref name="ASM 362" >The Amazing Spider-Man #362</ref> the Carnage symbiote was born with abilities even more singular than those of its progenitor\xe2\x80\x94due to the fact that it gestated in an environment alien to it\xe2\x80\x94[[Earth]]. The alien symbiote endows Kasady with physical strength greater than that of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] combined<ref name="ASM 362" /> and shape-shifting abilities, allows him to project a web-like substance from any part of his body including the formation of weapons, and enables him to plant thoughts into a person\'s head using a symbiote [[tendril]].<ref name="Carnage: Mind Bomb">\'\'Carnage: Mind Bomb\'\' one-shot</ref> Much like Spider-Man, Kasady has the ability to cling to virtually any surface, and has a version of Spider-Man\'s spider-sense, as the symbiote can relay information to him from any angle and grants Kasady the ability to "see" in any direction, warning him of incoming threats.<ref name="ASM 361" /><ref name="SMU 2">\'\'Spider-Man Unlimited #2\'\'</ref> He can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slick surfaces. The Carnage symbiote has abilities similar to that of Spider-Man as a direct result of the Venom symbiote\'s first host, Peter Parker, who transferred some of Spider-Man\'s power into the symbiote.\n\nHe is able to regenerate damaged body tissues much faster and more extensively than that of an ordinary human. This has been shown as powerful enough to allow him to regenerate from decapitation.<ref name="Venom Vol 2 #27">\'\'Venom Vol 2 #27\'\'</ref><ref name="AXIS: Carnage #3">\'\'AXIS:Carnage #3\'\'</ref> However, after being torn in half by the Sentry, he was fitted with artificial legs, but this occurred while he was separated from the symbiote.<ref name="Carnage"/> Kasady is also immune to the effects of all Earthly diseases and infections as long as he remains bonded with the symbiote. Like Venom, the symbiote is vulnerable to sound (to a much smaller degree than Venom) and heat (to a much larger degree than Venom),<ref name="Marvel Univ Handbook: SM 2004">\'\'The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man\'\', 2004</ref> and is undetectable to Spider-Man\'s spider-sense. Unlike Venom, Carnage can launch parts of his symbiote at enemies in the form of solid weapons such as darts, spears, knives, axes, etc., although they disintegrate into dust within ten seconds of leaving Carnage\'s body.<ref name="ASM 361" /> Carnage also has the unique ability to warp his appendages into different arms, legs, and even wings. This is shown on several occasions when Carnage mutates his fingers and arms into what look like large swords.\n\nKasady has full control over the size, shape, color (usually red and black), texture, and hardness of his symbiote (and any part thereof). Like Venom, he can make his symbiote look like normal clothing (which he has done on rare occasion), or act as "camouflage". With the symbiote bonded to his bloodstream, he can "regenerate" his costume from scratch simply by bleeding. His symbiote has the peculiar ability to block its parent\'s ([[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]\'s) ability to sense and track it.<ref name="Marvel Univ Handbook: SM 2004" /> The symbiote is also able to rapidly adapt to new environments: when Kasady was taken into space by the Sentry,<ref name="New Avengers 1-2">\'\'[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x932</ref> the Carnage symbiote was able to save his life by growing small sacks around his mouth that converted carbon dioxide into oxygen, allowing Kasady to stay alive long enough for him to be recovered.<ref name="Carnage" />\n\nIn some interpretations, the Carnage symbiote is [[Vampire|vampiric]], feeding on and thus endangering his victims by only a mere touch.<ref name="New Avengers 1-2" />  The symbiote has also shown the ability to call parts of itself back to the main symbiote, reintegrating them. It can also send irresistible commands to parts of itself that are in technology; these were used to break the bones of the Iron Rangers when they challenged Carnage while wearing symbiote-enhanced technological exo-suits. Using these last two abilities, Carnage absorbed the five Iron Rangers, grew to an enormous size, and became blue.<ref name="Carnage" />\n\nFinally, Carnage\'s powers have always been abnormally enhanced from the maniacal will and insane worldview that Kasady has had from the age of 8 years old.<ref name="SM 36">\'\'Spider-Man\'\' #36</ref> Kasady sees chaos and random, undirected violence as reality, and considers order and virtue to be illusions.<ref name="ASM 361-363">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #361\xe2\x80\x93363</ref> He takes an almost artistic pride in his mayhem,<ref name="ASM 430-431" /> likes to leave a trail for others to follow (usually leaving the phrase "Carnage Rules" written in his own blood), and is recklessly willing to take on the most dangerous and powerful opponents and victims.<ref name="ASM 361-363" /> On rare occasions, however, he has deliberately spared individuals to serve as witnesses for others: for instance, [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joe Robertson]]\'s wife Martha during \'\'Savage Rebirth\'\'.<ref name="ASM 430">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #430</ref> Kasady is essentially taking revenge on the whole world for the torments, both real and imagined, of his childhood.<ref name="SM 36" /><ref name="SM & B 1">\'\'Spider-Man and Batman\'\' #1</ref>\n\nWhen the Carnage symbiote was joined with Norman Osborn, the resulting combination was immune to traditional symbiote weaknesses of sound and fire, although Anti-Venom\'s touch was still dangerous.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Exiles===\nThe Earth-15 psychotic Peter Parker and Carnage combine to become the "\'\'\'Spider\'\'\'", and becomes a member of [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#Weapon X|Weapon X]] in \'\'[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]\'\'.<ref name="Exiles 13">\'\'Exiles\'\' #12</ref>\n\n===MC2===\nIn the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] future timeline, Carnage bonds with [[Spider-Girl]]\'s friend, [[Moose Mansfied]].<ref name="ASG 9">\'\'Amazing Spider-Girl\'\' #9\xe2\x80\x9312</ref> He also infects Spider-Girl\'s [[Benjamin Richard Parker|little brother]], turning him into a miniature version of himself. Spider-Girl uses the sonic blasters of the villain [[Reverb (comics)|Reverb]] to destroy all traces of the symbiote.\n\nIn a later timeline, samples of the symbiote are used to create "Biopreds", living weapons that the government use to try to stop \'\'\'Mayhem\'\'\', Spider-Girl\'s part-symbiote clone, who, after killing the real Spider-Girl, became a murderous vigilante, eventually killing the hero [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]]. The Biopreds run wild, however, decimating the world and its defenders. Mayhem, seeing the error of her ways, goes back in time and sacrifices herself to stop her past self from killing Spider-Girl, ensuring the events that led to the Biopreds\' creation never occurred.<ref name="SG: The End">\'\'Spider-Girl: The End\'\'</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Carnage is a self-regenerating vampiric organism. This version is created from DNA samples of both [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) and the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], and combined with samples from [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]]\'s [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|symbiotic suit research]]. When first introduced, the organism was a blob of instinct, with no intelligence or self-awareness, with its only aim to feed on the DNA of others, including [[Gwen Stacy]], to stabilize itself. After feeding on multiple people, Carnage turns into a damaged form of Richard. Carnage and Peter battle to which Peter throws Carnage into a fire factor steel chimney, killing the beast. But before its death, the organism splintered into a replica of Gwen\'s form.<ref name="USM 128">\'\'Ultimate Spider-Man\'\' #128</ref><ref name="USM Images">{{cite web|url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/dor/objects/739976/ultimate-spider-man/images/ultimate-spider-man-20081016061615870.html?page=mediaFull |title=Video Games, Wikis, Cheats, Walkthroughs, Reviews, News & Videos \xe2\x80\x93 IGN |publisher= }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Venomverse===\nWhen Venom and Eddie Brock from Prime Earth were recruited into a war between lethal protectors from across the multiverse and the symbiote-eating Poisons, the Venoms from the multiverse were on the ropes until Eddie had the bright idea to recruit the psychopath Carnage to their side.

In his self-titled episode "Carnage", the original form is created when the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] injects Peter Parker with a symbiote sample to be a perfect Venom but Peter\'s spider cells makes the organism unstable and imperfect. With Peter as his host, Carnage is sent by the Goblin to eliminate Spider-Man; the Goblin, while approving of this new \'son\', didn\'t know Spider-Man and Peter are the same individual. Carnage attacks [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] and the [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees]], fighting through Spider-Man\'s allies but stops when [[Harry Osborn]] absorbs the symbiote to free Peter while Venom\'s form returns which leaves Carnage inactive. The second iteration later appears in \'\'Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister Six\'\' as a completely different creature.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Symbiote Saga Pt. 1|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=13|airdate=July 3, 2016}}</ref> The organism is the main focus in the three-part "Symbiote Saga" as a weaponized armor for [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. This version is created by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] from a symbiote sample forcibly taken from Agent Venom. After being injected with Doctor Octopus\'s vampire bat DNA serum, Morbius retaliates by throwing the new symbiote on Doc Ock. Spider-Man and [[Flash Thompson]] then fight \'\'\'[[Doctor Octopus|Carnage-Ock]]\'\'\' until Spider-Man uses a sound device, resulting in separation which also neutralized its host\'s nanites. Carnage then turns into his familiar form with a red-and-black hybrid look with black teeth, speaking and acting on its own, no longer needing a host to cause chaos. Carnage fights with Spider-Man and then Agent Venom, tricking the two young heroes into exploding himself so that the civilians below can become infected by the symbiote\'s fragments. The fragmented symbiote possess every civilian in Manhattan (including [[J. Jonah Jameson]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]]). Spider-Man works with [[Captain America]] and S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy to fight \'\'\'[[Hulk (comics)|Carnage-Hulk]]\'\'\' and various other hosts as the Carnage-possessed civilians causes [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]]\'s reawakening from [[Oscorp]]. While [[Mary Jane Watson]] (via Midtown High) uses [[Daily Bugle|Daily Bugle Communications]]\' network to help innocent civilians, Spider-Man manages to gets Anti-Venom atop Carnage\'s \'heart\' where Harry sacrifices the Anti-Venom symbiote to undo Carnage\'s control over everyone. However, Carnage reassembles into a giant creature that Spider-Man and Agent Venom fight, resulting in the creature enveloping Midtown High. Now a hive in Midtown High, Carnage\'s forms (miniature versions, Spider-like creatures and wasps-like creatures) are fought by Spider-Man, Agent Venom and the Patrioteer fight before having a deadly encounter with the \'\'\'[[Mary Jane Watson|Carnage Queen]]\'\'\' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Symbiote Saga Pt. 3|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=15|airdate=July 17, 2016}}</ref>). Morbius and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] plan to use deactivated HYDRA missiles confiscated by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] below Midtown High to send symbiote drones to every city in the world. After Crossbones\'s escape and Morbius\'s defeat, Mary Jane overcomes Carnage\'s control and Flash deactivates the symbiote missiles. "The Spider-Slayers" revealed Mary Jane embraces the Carnage symbiote within and assumes the Spider-Woman identity (referenced as Spider-MJ) thanks to Dr. Connors\'s experiment which help control the organism completely.\n* The Carnage symbiote that appears in the \'\'[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]\'\' animated series is one created by Thanos during his experiments with the symbiotes, genetically modified to be obedient to him and enable him to control all other symbiotes and their hosts.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Back in the New York Groove|series=Guardians of the Galaxy|network=Disney XD|season=3|number=1|airdate=March 18, 2018}}</ref> In the episodes "Back in the New York Groove" and "Drive My Carnage", the Carnage symbiote freed Thanos after he was buried under Manhattan and bonded with the Titan at his command to commence spreading itself across the city before it was destroyed by the Guardians and Spider-Man.\n\n===Film===\n* Cletus Kasady appears in a post-credits scene of the 2018 film \'\'[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]\'\', played by [[Woody Harrelson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/08/venom-director-on-saving-carnage-for-the-sequel-and-casting-woody-harrelson|title=Venom Director on Setting Up Carnage and Cletus Kasady for the Sequel|first=Jim|last=Vejvoda|date=7 October 2018|website=Ign.com|accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/5416571/who-is-carnage-venom/|title=Venom Credits Scene Explained: What to Know About Carnage|website=Time|accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.comicbookmovie.com/venom/venom-get-your-first-low-res-look-at-woody-harrelson-as-spoiler-a163891|title=VENOM: Get Your First Low-Res Look At Woody Harrelson As [SPOILER]|access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref> In the scene, Kasady is visited by Eddie Brock for an interview in prison, and Kasady proclaims that when he escapes, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\'s gonna be carnage\xe2\x80\x9d.

The house was located at [[Marvel Super Hero Island]] under the scarezone "Island Under Siege". Carnage also was the icon chosen to represent that specific island for the event, as he killed all of the superheroes and took over the "island", allowing criminals, gangbangers, and villains to roam free with no regards to [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]. The event\'s main icon, "The Caretaker", chose him based on his disregard for life and desire to see total chaos.<ref name="Horror Nights">{{cite web|url=http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/orlando/hhn/islands_under_siege.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001073503/http://themeparks.universalstudios.com/orlando/hhn/islands_under_siege.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 October 2002|title=Hallowen Horror Nights|date=1 October 2002|publisher=}}</ref><ref name="Open The Vault">[http://www.hhnvault.com/haunts/hhn12_houses.htm Open the Vault.

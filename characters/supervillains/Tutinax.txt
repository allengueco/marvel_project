Dromedan began to enthrall the local [[Inca]]n people into his slaves.  When [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and three [[Eternal (comics)|Eternals]] ([[Virako]], [[Valkin]], and [[Ajak]]) arrived to stop Dromedan, Tutinax fought them.  The three Eternals knocked him unconscious, and before Dromedan could revive him, Tutinax disappeared.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nTutinax reappeared in modern times, having been summoned by the Deviant Zakka to stop the Eternals who were after him.  Tutinax killed Zakka, then fought [[Thena]], [[Ransak the Reject]] and [[Karkas (comics)|Karkas]].  Ransak and Karkas battled Tutinax and just as they combined forces to defeat him, Tutinax was pulled back into the past.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nLater, in modern times, Tutinax and Ransak fought each other again, this time as gladiators in [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]].  [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] appeared just as Tutinax had nearly defeated Ransak, and challenged him to a fight.  Tutinax used his powers to appear as Quasar\'s father, which prevented him from fighting back.  Ransak used Quasar\'s distraction to defeat Tutinax with his power-lance.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nIn the 2012 comics mini-series \'\'Thor: The Deviants Saga\'\', Tutinax twice faced [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in single combat and on both occasions Tutinax was near to winning when he was commanded to stop and immediately obeyed without question despite his great desire to finish the [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thunder God]].<ref>\'\'Thor: The Deviants Saga\'\' No.2, Feb 2012; \'\'Thor: The Deviants Saga\'\' No.3 March 2012</ref> At the end of the series Tutinax is one of the significant few Deviants listed as "missing" following the narrowly averted catastrophe precipitated by [[Kro (comics)|Kro]]\'s reckless activation of the Unbinding Stone of Oshemar.<ref>\'\'Thor: The Deviants Saga\'\' No.5, May 2012</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nTutinax possesses immense superhuman strength and resilience. He also has the ability to inspire great dread in his opponents, on occasions even assuming the appearance of the person or thing his opponent most fears.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/tutinax.htm|Tutinax}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Deviants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}'

The Organizer was secretly Abner Jonas, a candidate for mayor of New York City, who sent the Ani-Men on missions to undermine the current administration. Daredevil defeated them and the Ani-Men and Organizer all went to prison.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #10-11</ref> Later, Ape-Man, Bird-Man and Cat-Man formed a team called the "Unholy Three" with the [[Death-Stalker|Exterminator]], and fought Daredevil again.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #39-41</ref> The Unholy Three, as a team of independent thieves, fought Daredevil and [[Spider-Man]] and were defeated.<ref>\'\'Marvel Team-Up\'\' #25</ref>\n\nApe-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man later rejoined the Ani-Men, and the Ani-Men went to work for [[Count Nefaria]]. Nefaria\'s scientists submitted the unwitting Ani-Men to processes that gave them superhuman powers and animal-like forms. The Ani-Men invaded the Cheyenne Mountain missile base for Count Nefaria, and fought the [[X-Men]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #94-95</ref>\n\nThe Ani-Men lost their superhuman powers and reverted to normal. Nefaria sent the four original Ani-Men to kill [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. However, the [[Spymaster (comics)#Spymaster I|Spymaster]] detonated a bomb, which was intended to kill Stark, and the resulting explosion killed the Ani-Men instead.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #115-116</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Roy McVey===\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics--> \nimage=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Ape-Man\n|real_name=Roy McVey\n|species=\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=\'\'[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]\'\' #157 (Mar 1979) \n|creators=[[Roger McKenzie (comics)|Roger McKenzie]]<br>[[Mary Jo Duffy]]<br>[[Gene Colan]]\n|alliances=[[Ani-Men]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=Ape-like superhuman strength, agility, durability and reflexes<br>Use of T-Ray Gun\n}}\n\nAfter the deaths of the original Ani-Men, the [[Death-Stalker]] recruits a new team of Ani-Men, with a new Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man.

They somehow got the equipment of the original Ani-Men and used it to rob a vault wagon only to be opposed by the NYPD.<ref>\'\'Code of Honor\'\' #3</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\'\' storyline, Ape-Man alongside the third Bird-Man and the third Cat-Man were among the villains in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]\'s supervillain army.<ref>\'\'Civil War: War Crimes\'\' #1</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nOriginally, Keefer had no superhuman powers. He was an athletic man with a powerful build and considerable strength, and an excellent hand-to-hand combatant trained in boxing and wrestling techniques. While employed by the Exterminator, Keefer wielded a "time-displacement ray" ("T-ray") gun that fired a ray which projected its victim into a limbo-like inter-dimensional void.  The gun could thus "displace" a victim for a limited period of time, such as 30 minutes. A ray blast of sufficient intensity could exile a victim to the inter-dimensional void permanently. Keefer was later subjected to an unknown mutagenic process administered by [[Count Nefaria]]\'s scientists which temporarily gave him a build resembling that of an ape, as well as superhuman strength and enhanced agility, durability and reflexes.\n\nMcVey possessed the same abilities as the first Ape-Man, including ape-like superhuman strength, agility, durability and reflexes.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/apemankeefer.htm|Ape-Man (Keefer)}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Chuck Dixon]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Don Heck]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gene Colan]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roger McKenzie]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Wally Wood]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1965]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1979]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1997]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

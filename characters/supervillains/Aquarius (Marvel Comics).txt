However, after Aquarius took on the other Zodiac forms one time each (thereby representing a \'\'zodiacal\'\' year) while battling [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], Slifer returned and claimed his body and soul.<ref>\'\'Ghost Rider\'\' #6-7 (June, August 1974)</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===Zachary Drebb===\n{{Infobox comics character\n| image=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Aquarius\n|real_name=Zachary Drebb\n|species=\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=\'\'[[Iron Man]]\'\' #184 (Jul 1984)\n|creators=[[Dennis O\'Neil]] and [[Luke McDonnell]]\n|alliances=[[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=\n}}\nTaurus ordered \'\'\'Aquarius II\'\'\' and third Aries to kill [[War Machine|Iron Man (James Rhodes)]], but both failed.<ref>\'\'[[Iron Man]]\'\' #183-185</ref> A new android [[Life Model Decoy|LMD]] version of the Zodiac appeared, led by Scorpio in a new android body, massacred the human Zodiac, and took over their criminal operations.<ref>\'\'West Coast Avengers\'\' Vol. 2 #26 (November 1987)</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===Aquarius (LMD)===\n{{Infobox comics character\n| image=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Aquarius\n|real_name=\n|species=\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=\'\'Defenders\'\' #49\n|creators=\n|alliances=[[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=\n}}\nAn android Aquarius was a [[Life Model Decoy]] created by [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio (Jacob Fury)]] in his "Theatre Of Genetics" to be part of his Zodiac crime organization. Scorpio went after his brother, [[Nick Fury]], with his new group, but was defeated by [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] and [[Moon Knight]].<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #48-50</ref> The Zodiac LMD\'s were recruited by [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] during his bout with temporary insanity, and Quicksilver ordered the Zodiac LMD\'s to destroy [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for their imagined wrongdoings. The Avengers managed to defeat the group and most were remanded into federal custody.<ref>\'\'West Coast Avengers Annual\'\' #1</ref>\n\nThe android Zodiac were soon released, and the Scorpio LMD rebuilt a number of them. Scorpio used the Zodiac Key to create LMDs that exemplified the forces and personalities inherent in each sign, hoping to create great strength in the combination of all twelve traits of the Zodiac. He arranged the ambush in which the android Zodiac killed all of the remaining human Zodiac leaders except Cornelius van Lunt, alias [[Taurus (comics)|Taurus]]. It was later revealed the Libra had also survived the attack on the original Zodiac Cartel. Immediately afterward, Van Lunt sought out the services of the Avengers\' West Coast branch to confront and defeat the android Zodiac. He was destroyed by Hawkeye in a battle with the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>\'\'West Coast Avengers\'\' Vol. 2 #26-28</ref>\n\nThe Zodiac Key immediately resurrected the Scorpio LMD. Claiming superiority and believing that the Zodiac would eventually kill the Avengers as the androids could never be stopped, Scorpio wanted to use the Key to transport everyone on the scene to the Key\'s native dimension where the conflict, he believed, could be prolonged indefinitely. However, when the androids were in the other dimension, they ceased to function because each of them were aligned with a particular zodiacal energy, energy that did not exist in the other dimension. The Avengers found [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Tigra]] had been sent to the same dimension and, reunited, the team was sent back to Earth by the Brotherhood. However, secretly the Brotherhood waited so that someday they could also send the Key to Earth again and create new conflicts for them.<ref>\'\'West Coast Avengers\'\' #26-28</ref>\n\n===Aquarius (Ecliptic)===\n{{Infobox comics character\n| image=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Virgo\n|real_name=\n|species=\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=\'\'Alpha Flight\'\' vol. 2 #2\n|creators=\n|alliances=[[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=\n}}\nAquarius was a later addition to the Zodiac. A man of few words, he tended to remain in the background despite his power.

He appears as a member of the Zodiac. Aquarius is depicted as an alien (just like the other Zodiacs in this show) with a fish-like appearance and water-based attacks.\n* Aquarius appears in \'\'[[Marvel Anime: Iron Man]]\'\' episode "Arc Station, Infection".{{cn|date=July 2017}} This version is a massive robot parasite built by Zodiac. It attached itself and utilized the JSDF Sat.1 surveillance satellite solar panels to direct radiation directly down at the Arc Station, only for the building\'s shielding to deflect the radiation into the surrounding area, spreading radiation poisoning among the population area. Tony Stark using Dr. Tanaka\'s prototype technology and a ride from Sakurai to launched himself into the stratosphere to battle it. Aquarius gained an early upper hand with a surprise attack, even managing to disable Iron Man and draw him into itself, but the victory was short lived as Iron Man blasted his way out and soon finished off Aquarius.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/1mzodc.htm|Aquarius I}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/aquarius2.htm|Aquarius 2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aquarius (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Dennis O\'Neil]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1970]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who have made pacts with devils]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

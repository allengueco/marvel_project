He was a [[supervillain]] and descendant of the [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|original Black Knight]], and was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Dick Ayers]].\n\n==Publication history==\nProfessor Nathan Garrett debuted as the modern-day supervillain Black Knight in \'\'[[Tales to Astonish]]\'\' vol. 1, #52 (Feb. 1964).

He becomes a biologist, research scientist, and university professor. He then became the head of an espionage ring, and was captured by the hero Giant-Man. Garrett fled to Europe, where he found Sir Percy\'s tomb and the [[Ebony Blade]]. Garrett\'s evil tendencies make him unworthy of wielding the sword, and he is shunned by Sir Percy\'s ghost. The embittered Garrett then devises an arsenal of medieval weapons that employ modern technology (including a lance that fired bolts of energy) and genetically engineers and creates a winged horse called [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]]. Calling himself the "Black Knight", Garrett embarks on a career as a professional criminal to spite his ancestor. He battled Giant-Man again and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] but is defeated.<ref>\'\'Tales to Astonish\'\' vol. 1 #52</ref>\n\nGarrett joins the supervillain team the [[Masters of Evil]] at the request of master villain [[Heinrich Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]], and spread Adhesive X over the city.

This is a big factor in his becoming the villain Doctor Bong. How he developed his paraphernalia was never explained.\n\nIt is revealed that he was also a skilled scientist, using his knowledge of [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] to create several devices and creatures to do his bidding, particularly [[Fifi the Duck]], who was the closest thing Bong had to a henchwoman.<ref>"Howard the Duck" #17</ref>\n\nHe had a longtime crush on [[Beverly Switzler]], whom he eventually married.  Before he was removed from the book, [[Steve Gerber]] had intended their marriage to last and for her to no longer be a main character in the \'\'Howard the Duck\'\' series. After Gerber left, [[Bill Mantlo]] brought Beverly, now single again, back to the book.\n\n[[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] later pitted Bong against [[She-Hulk]], trying to uncensor sanitized violent television so that his [[Genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] [[multiple birth|quintuplets]] would be raised not finding violence at all attractive.

At sword point, Bong reveals all the information he knows about current power struggles.<ref>"Daughters of the Dragon" #3.</ref>\n\nHe appeared in \'\'[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]\'\' as one of the villains in the Bar with No Name.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #562</ref>\n\nDoctor Bong is one of the many villains kidnapped into a roller derby staged by the cosmic game-obsessed entity called the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]].

While at their main base the real Secret Avengers infiltrated the base causing the real Steve Rogers to battle with Deadpool. After pummeling each other, the real Moon Knight steps in and things finally calm down enough that Cap and Deadpool can talk, Doctor Bong realizes that he has officially lost. He sets off an explosion that kills the Marc Spector and Natasha Romanoff clones, apparently collapsing the building on all the occupants.<ref>\'\'Deadpool\'\' #28</ref> Deadpool then teams up with the [[Secret Avengers]] to stop Doctor Bong. Doctor Bong tries to confuse the Secret Avengers and Deadpool by dressing all his genetic regenerative clones as Deadpool.

The character has been depicted as a member of the [[Mutant Liberation Front]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThumbelina was often picked on by the other members of the team, particularly [[Wildside (comics)|Wildside]] and [[Strobe (comics)|Strobe]].  [[Stryfe]] often kept Thumbelina in the reserves, and only sent her out when he absolutely needed to. Because of her weight, she would get tired very easily, especially when [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]] used her time altering powers to grant the team super speed.\n\nHowever, Thumbelina's powers were useful to the group, as she provided easy access to difficult areas; she also became skilled in using her power for sneak attacks.  In one mission, Thumbelina was able to repair a bomb that was severed by gunfire, and enabled the Mutant Liberation Front to succeed in their mission.<ref>''New Mutants'' (1st series) #86</ref>  She was later sent to release the captured [[Nasty Boys]], [[Slab (comics)|Slab]] and [[Hairbag]]. Slab turned out to be Thumbelina's brother, who has the complementary ability to grow in size to an extent, and they have a close relationship together.<ref>''X-Factor'' (1st series) #77</ref>\n\nHer only friend in the Mutant Liberation Front was [[Dragoness (comics)|Dragoness]], who was the only member that didn't make fun of her.\n\nThumbelina was then seen among Stryfe's Mutant Liberation Front as they battled a creature called Skornn.<ref>''X-Force'' #4-5 (2005)</ref>\n\nSeveral years later, Thumbelina attended a support group created by [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] for mutants with visual mutations.<ref>''Domino Annual'' #1 (2018)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThumbelina has the mutant ability to shrink her body while increasing her strength at the same time.\n\n==Other versions==\nThumbelina appeared in ''[[What If (comics)|What if?]]'' #46-47 as a member of the Mutant Liberation Force that battled the [[Fantastic Four]] and later joined [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] after the death of Stryfe.<ref>''What If?'' #46-47</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/thumbelinamlf.htm|Thumbelina}}\n*[https://www.marvel.com/characters/thumbelina Thumbelina] at Marvel.com\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Fabian Nicieza]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Rob Liefeld]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can change size]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"

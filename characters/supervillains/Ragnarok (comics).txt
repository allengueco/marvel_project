A cyborg clone of the hero [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], Ragnar\xc3\xb6k has a similar appearance and abilities but uses them in opposition to the established heroes.\n\n==Publication history==\nRagnar\xc3\xb6k first appeared in \'\'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\'\' #3 (July 2006), and was created by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Steve Mcniven]].\n\nRagnar\xc3\xb6k began appearing as a regular character in the \'\'Dark Avengers\'\' series, beginning with \'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #175.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWhen the real [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] was missing in action, presumed dead, [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] took one of his hairs, which he had retained from the first meeting of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and helped [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Hank Pym]] clone the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[DNA]] within while fusing the cloned DNA with Stark technology. This resulted in the creation of a new cyborg clone of Thor. The clone was put into action during the superhero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], sent to battle anti-registration heroes.<ref>[[Mark Millar]]. \'\'Civil War\'\' #3; September 2006</ref> The heroes were easily brought down by the clone, but [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] helped the heroes to escape. The battle got out of hand when the clone murdered [[Bill Foster (comics)|Goliath]] by blasting him through the chest and set out to kill the rest of the anti-registration heroes. Reed Richards deactivated the cyborg with a vocal code and later operated on his brain to prevent such a mishap from happening again.<ref>Mark Millar. \'\'Civil War\'\' #4; October 2006</ref> The new Thor returned during the final battle between the pro- and anti-registration heroes. He faced off against [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] who defeat the clone by ramming his own hammer into his skull claiming it was an insult to the Odinson, and yelling \'Thou art no Thor\'.<ref>Mark Millar. \'\'Civil War\'\' #7; January 2007</ref> The clone\'s remains were taken to [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]] and stored in the laboratory for experimentation. [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]] tells Pym he admires his work, showing the Thor clone to demonstrate this.\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Secret Invasion]]\'\' storyline, it was revealed that the Hank Pym who helped create the clone was actually the clone of a [[Skrull]] impostor named Criti Noll who had placed a program into the cloned Thor\'s remains as a contingency in case of the invasion\'s failure. Unless a special code which only the Skrull knew was input every eighteen days, the clone would reawaken. With the clone of Criti Noll\'s death during the Invasion, this event came to pass during the \'\'[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\'\' storyline. Malfunctioning, and believing himself to be the true Thor, the clone believed he had been imprisoned in Camp Hammond. He threatened Baron Von Blitzschlag into returning his hammer to him and set out to destroy [[Avengers: The Initiative|the Initiative]].<ref name="AvengInit#21">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Christos N.

During that time, he took on the name Ragnar\xc3\xb6k (which the Baron had called him, declaring that he would "bring the end of all that is"). Ragnar\xc3\xb6k was only stopped when Von Blitzschlag, whose electrical powers made him immune to Ragnar\xc3\xb6k\'s lightning, arrived on the battlefield. The Baron showed Ragnar\xc3\xb6k footage of his creation, and showed him that the real Thor had returned and had formed a new [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] above the city. Disgusted by what he perceived as Asgard\'s "indignity", Ragnar\xc3\xb6k left Camp Hammond to confront the real Thor.<ref name="AvengInit#22">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Christos N.

Iron Man assumes that Mister Fantastic is responsible for Ragnar\xc3\xb6k and flies off.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #184</ref> Having gotten control of this world\'s Hank Pym, June Covington learns the history of this reality and then uses some Stark teleportation technology to remove a device from Ragnar\xc3\xb6k\'s brain.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #185</ref> When Barney Barton wakes up in Iron Man\'s lab to see U.S. Agent restored, he also sees that Ragnar\xc3\xb6k is still unconscious and Ai Apaec is in miniature form.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #186</ref> Iron Man returns to his tower and finds that Henry Pym is experimenting on Ragnar\xc3\xb6k by removing his control implant.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #187</ref> Moonstone and Ragnar\xc3\xb6k arrive at the site where this Earth\'s Thor died fighting Hulk and where Thor\'s hammer Mjolnir lies. Ragnar\xc3\xb6k acknowledges that he is just a copy of the real Thor and that he does not know who or what he is. He then grasps the hammer. Lightning then strikes and Ragnar\xc3\xb6k emerges with a new bald look and goatee.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #189</ref> Ragnar\xc3\xb6k then comes crashing down devastating Thing\'s monsters. As this reality was starting to the sliver of time that A.I.M. having claimed starting to be distorted, the Dark Avengers race to find the A.I.M. base. Their arrival is detected and the A.I.M. agents attempt to close the sliver gate, but Ragnar\xc3\xb6k manages to keep it open for the entire team to enter. Ragnar\xc3\xb6k and the rest of the Dark Avengers were able to return to their world.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #190</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs a [[cyborg]] [[cloning|clone]] of Thor, Ragnar\xc3\xb6k has all the powers and knowledge of the God of Thunder, (prior to Thor\'s acquisition of the Odinforce) including super-strength, extensive combat knowledge, godly stamina, high resistance to physical injury, immunity to all Earthly diseases, and superhuman agility and reflexes.\n\nRagnar\xc3\xb6k\'s hammer, though not the enchanted [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], is constructed of a vibranium and adamantium alloy. The hammer is able to absorb and discharge lightning, like the true Mjolnir, and has circuitry within its head, which allows Ragnar\xc3\xb6k to direct it mentally. However, unlike Mjolnir, it can be picked up or lifted by others.\n\nDuring a visit to Earth-13584, Ragnar\xc3\xb6k acquires that universe\'s version of Mjolnir and is accepted as worthy to wield it, changing him into what would seem to be a mortal being making him one of the few characters worthy to wield Mjolnir.\n\n==Other versions==\n===What If?===\nIn a "[[What If (comics)|What If?]] Civil War" scenario titled "What if Iron Man Lost the Civil War," Iron Man confronted [[Captain America]] and admitted that while he felt he was doing the right thing, he was worried that he was going about it the wrong way and that he needed Cap\'s help. This admission persuades Captain America not to use a concealed device that would have disabled Iron Man\'s armor. Unfortunately, an agent on board the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier detected the device and released Ragnar\xc3\xb6k prematurely. Reed Richards was quickly knocked out by the clone before Richards could employ the shutdown code. When Ragnar\xc3\xb6k tried to kill Bill Foster, Iron Man leapt in front of him to block the blast. Ragnar\xc3\xb6k then attempted to kill Iron Man, but Captain America held him off long enough for Iron Man\'s armor to repair itself. The two heroes then joined forces, which inspired every other hero in the pro/anti-registration conflict to join together to defeat Ragnar\xc3\xb6k.<ref>\'\'What If?

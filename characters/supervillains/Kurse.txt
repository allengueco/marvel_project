Created by writer/artist [[Walter Simonson]], the character first appears as the [[Elves (Marvel Comics)|Dark Elf]] \'\'\'Algrim the Strong\'\'\' in  \'\'Thor\'\' #347 (Sep. 1984). He is later transformed into Kurse in \'\'[[Secret Wars II]]\'\' #4 (Oct. 1985).\n\nAlgrim is portrayed by [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] in the 2013 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film \'\'[[Thor: The Dark World]]\'\'.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=June 2014}}\nThe [[Elves (Marvel Comics)|Dark Elf]] \'\'\'Algrim the Strong\'\'\' was created by [[Walter Simonson]] and first appeared in \'\'Thor\'\' #347 (Sep. 1984). The character was transformed into Kurse in \'\'[[Secret Wars II]]\'\' #4 (Oct. 1985).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nKurse was originally the most powerful of a race of Dark Elves and was known as Algrim the Strong. He is coerced by the Dark Elf ruler [[Malekith the Accursed]] to fight the Asgardian God of Thunder and [[superhero]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Malekith, however, betrays Algrim while he is fighting Thor, and in a bid to destroy the Thunder God orders that a pitfall beneath the two be opened. Thor saves himself courtesy of his mystical hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], while Algrim falls into lava. Algrim\'s enchanted armor saves his life, but he is still critically injured and develops [[amnesia]] from the shock.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #347 - 348 (vol. 1, Sep. - Oct. 1984)</ref>\n\nAlgrim is completely amnesic, except for his obsessive desire to gain revenge upon Thor. Algrim is later healed by the cosmic entity the [[Beyonder]], who transforms him into the much more powerful being called Kurse, who is apparently twice as strong as Thor. The Beyonder transports Kurse to Earth to battle Thor, however Kurse mistakes Thor\'s ally [[Beta Ray Bill]] for Thor and battles him.<ref>\'\'Secret Wars\'\' {{issue|date=September 2012}} (vol. 2, Oct. 1985)</ref><ref>\'\'Secret Wars\'\' #6 (vol. 2, Dec. 1985)</ref> Kurse then battles the juvenile superhero team, [[Power Pack]].<ref>\'\'Power Pack\'\' #18 (May. 1985)</ref> Thor dons his magical belt of strength to double his strength and confronts Kurse, however the Beyonder doubles Kurse\'s strength as well.{{issue|date=January 2014}}\n\nDespite overpowering Thor, Kurse is made to realize that it was Malekith, not Thor, who is to blame for his suffering. The Beyonder then transports Kurse to [[Asgard (comics)#The Nine Worlds|Hel]] at Thor\'s suggestion, to frustrate [[Hela (comics)|Hela]], the Goddess of Death.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #363 (vol. 1, Jan. 1986)</ref> Kurse confronts and severely beats Loki, who had been disguised as Malekith. Drawing off, he leaves Loki injured and finds what he thinks is [[Balder (comics)|Balder the Brave]], surrounded by legions of [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardians]].  He barrels through them and slays his target, who turns out to be the true Malekith. After repenting, he is granted citizenship among the [[Asgard (comics)#The six races|Asgardians]].<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #367 - 368 (vol. 1, May - Jun. 1986)</ref>\n\nHe is designated as the guardian of the children of Asgard after he helped protect [[Volstagg]]\'s daughter and adopted sons during a plague,<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #382</ref> and loyally serves Asgard until the time of [[Ragnar\xc3\xb6k|Ragnarok]]. At the time of Ragnarok, all the Asgardians apparently perish, with the exception of Thor.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #85 (vol. 2, Dec. 2004)</ref>\n\nKurse is later captured by Malekith, who strips him of the armor. Algrim is sent to Nastrond Prison, where he is forced to serve out the rest of the sentence of Wazaria, a former member of the League of Realms. Malekith forces Wazaria to don the armor, transforming her into the new Kurse. Before he is imprisoned, Algrim encourages his successor to kill herself the first chance she gets.<ref>\'\'The Mighty Thor\'\' (vol. 2) #14</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nKurse possesses a number of superhuman attributes because he is a dark elf and has been mystically augmented. Kurse\'s main advantage is his strength - which originally was a close match to Thor\'s, but since then his strength was quadrupled in comparison to Thor\'s.<ref>\'\'The Mighty Thor\'\' #363</ref> He also has enchanted armor that has been fused to his skin by the Beyonder. Kurse is now almost totally invulnerable, except to [[iron]], like all dark elves. Kurse can also track his opponents over thousands of miles and can see past illusions and disguises. His enchanted armor is living and sentient and allows Kurse to see everything around him.\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\n[[File:Kurse in Thor The Dark World.png|thumb|right|180px|Kurse is portrayed by [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] in the 2013 film \'\'[[Thor: The Dark World]]\'\'.]]\n* Algrim appears in the animated [[direct-to-video]] film \'\'[[Thor: Tales of Asgard]]\'\', voiced by [[Ron Halder]].

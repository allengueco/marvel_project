The character subsequently appears in \'\'Rampaging Hulk\'\' #3 (June 1977), \'\'ROM\'\' #30 (May 1982), and \'\'Maximum Security\'\' #2 (December 2000). Metal Master received an entry in the \'\'All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z\'\' #7 (2006).\n\nThe second Metal Master first appeared in \'\'Avengers\'\' #676 and was created by [[Mark Waid]], [[Al Ewing]], Jim Zub, and Pepe Larraz.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Molyb===\nMetal Master was an alien who can psionically control the atoms and molecules of metals like the rest of his species on a planet in the Galaxy of Astra. He was banished from his world for trying to take it over. When he came to Earth, the Metal Master attacked Gamma Base and defeated the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] when he refused to join him, bombarding him with metal and preventing him from getting up close.  The Hulk returned with a plastic weapon; when the Metal Master\'s powers could not affect the gun, he was caught off guard and the Hulk easily beat him and forced him to reverse his actions.<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' #6</ref>\n\nThe Metal Master returned to Earth again later, seeking large amounts of metals that the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#A|Astrans]] thrive on. There he encountered the [[Spaceknights|Spaceknight]] [[Rom (comics)|Rom]], and tried to control Rom\'s metal armor.  Rom resisted him, and the Metal Master was nearly driven mad by the thought of a metal that he could not control.<ref>\'\'Rom\'\' #30</ref>\n\nLater, the Metal Master wound up in an intergalactic prison. During the events of "[[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]]", Metal Master was one of the many aliens sent to Earth and he fought the [[Scarlet Witch]].<ref>\'\'Maximum Security\'\' #1-3</ref>\n\nSometime later, the Conclave of Seven Planets sentenced Metal Master to a deep space torture prison. He made acquaintances with his fellow cellmates [[Black Bolt]], [[Absorbing Man]], Blinky, and Raava.<ref>\'\'Black Bolt\'\' #2</ref> He and his fellow inmates escape after Absorbing Man seemingly sacrifices himself to help Black Bolt kill the torture prison\'s Jailer.<ref>\'\'Black Bolt\'\' #6</ref>\n\n===Molyn===\nA new Metal Master named Molyn appears in the "No Surrender" arc" as a member of [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]\'s [[Lethal Legion]] where he was nicknamed the "All-New Metal Master." He and the Lethal Legion go up against Challenger\'s [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]] in a contest where Earth is the battlefield.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #676-679. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Metal Master possesses the ability to animate and control virtually all known forms of metal. He can alter the shape and form of metals at will, forming complex objects out of them, levitate them, etc. One exception is Plandarium, the metal from which the armor of the Spaceknights of Galador is made. He can affect this Plandarium to some degree, but he cannot control it as with other metals.\n\n==In other media==\n* The Molyb version of Metal Master appeared in \'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' segment of \'\'[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]\'\', voiced by [[Paul Kligman]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Molyb_(Earth-616) Metal Master] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://comicvine.gamespot.com/metal-master/4005-14055/ Metal Master] at Comic Vine\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/mtlmst.htm|Metal Master}}\n\n{{Hulk}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Metal Master (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1963]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

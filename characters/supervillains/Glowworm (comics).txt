Though created only a few months apart, they have little in common except the name.\n\n==Fictional character biographies==\n\n===William Blake===\n{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Glowworm\n|real_name=William Blake\n|species=[[Human]] mutate\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=\'\'Power Man/Iron Fist\'\' #123 (May 1986)\n|creators=[[Jim Owsley]]<br>[[Mark Bright (comics)|Mark Bright]]<br>[[Jerry Acerno]]\n|alliances=\n|aliases=Race Killer, White Devil\n|powers=Superhuman strength and steel hard skin, shrug off double \n}}\n\nFirst appeared in \'\'[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]\'\' #123 (May, 1986). This Glowworm was William Blake, a former soldier who had volunteered for experiments to re-create the [[Captain America|Super-Soldier Serum]]. After leaving the Marine Corps, one night he transformed into a huge, glowing white creature who began screaming racial slurs and attacking black people in [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]\'s neighborhood. When news got out that a "white mutant" was attacking blacks, it nearly sparked a race [[riot]], but once Cage defeated the creature, it reverted to human form, revealing that he was a black man himself.{{issue|date=August 2013}} Blake had grown up in the [[Deep South]], at a time when rampant racism led him to believe that blacks were inferior to whites, resulting in his own hatred of himself and his own race.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/glowwormblake.htm]</ref>\n\nIt has been revealed that Glowworm has remained in custody since his initial capture.<ref>Avengers: Most Wanted Files.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Glowworm===\n{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=\n|caption = \n|character_name=Glowworm\n|real_name=\n|species=[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Human Mutant]]\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1#7 (August 1986)\n|creators=[[Louise Simonson|Louise Jones]]<br>[[Jackson Guise]]\n|alliances=[[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=Generate and release spheres of destructive energy \n}}\n\nThe second Glowworm first appeared in \'\'[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]\'\' #7 (August, 1986). This Glowworm is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with a humanoid torso, and a worm-like tail instead of legs. He is the partner of Bulk, a mutant with enormous size and strength.\n\nBulk and Glowworm were outcasts, not just for their mutant status or unusual appearance, but because both continually gave off toxic levels of hard [[radiation]]. The two sought shelter in a [[toxic waste]] dump in New Jersey, but upon hearing about the group X-Factor (who at that time were posing as mutant hunters), the pair decided to attack them to "protect mutants". After a short battle, the members of X-Factor explained their true nature as mutants themselves. The two returned to their isolation.{{issue|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn \'\'[[New Mutants]] Annual\'\' #4, Bulk and Glowworm seemingly sacrificed their lives to save [[Danielle Moonstar]].<ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/blkglwm.htm|Glow Worm}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}'

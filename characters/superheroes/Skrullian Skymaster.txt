The character is depicted as a member of the superhero team the [[Squadron Supreme]].\n\n==Concept==\nThe character is the Squadron\'s counterpart of the [[Martian Manhunter]], a member of [[DC Comics]]\' superhero team the [[Justice League]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n==Publication history==\nThe [[Skrull]] first appeared in \'\'Squadron Supreme\'\' #1 (August 1985) in a flashback, and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]].\n\nThe character subsequently appears in \'\'Squadron Supreme: New World Order\'\' #1 (September 1998), and \'\'Exiles\'\' #77\xe2\x80\x9378 (April\xe2\x80\x93May 2006).\n\nThe Skrull appeared as part of the "Squadron Supreme" entry in the \'\'[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]\'\' #12.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nIn an alternate reality to that in [[Earth-616|which most Marvel Comics stories]] take place, the [[Skrull]] Empire has been at war with the [[Kree Empire]]. In an attempt to end the bloodshed, the Skrull Empire created a means to imbue their soldiers with extraordinary powers to vanquish the Kree. Skymax was the first and the only soldier subjected to the experiments, because the [[Galactus|World Devourer]] destroyed the Skrull homeworld. Sk\'ym\'x was in the vicinity of Earth when his [[starship]] malfunctioned. He was rescued by American astronaut Joe Ledger (who would later become [[Doctor Spectrum]]). Grateful for his rescue, Skymax gave Ledger a Power Prism which Ledger used to become the costumed adventurer Doctor Spectrum, while Skymax became the costumed adventurer known as the Skrull. Skymax and Ledger both became founding members of the [[Squadron Supreme]], and Skymax remained with the team until member [[Tom Thumb (comics)|Tom Thumb]] repaired his ship allowing him to return to space.{{issue|date=December 2010}} Skymax realized that the damage to his ship was beyond repair despite Tom Thumb\'s efforts, and he chose to remain on Earth in secret, searching for any possibility of other Skrull survivors. Not finding any Skymax concluded that he was indeed the last of his race; he remained on Earth.{{issue|date=December 2010}}\n\nAfter the Squadron returned from their adventures on [[Earth-616]], the sorcerer Mysterium sent the surviving members to retrieve others to help in the rebellion against the Global Directorate. Doctor Spectrum was sent after "the Watcher" and discovered Skymax. Renaming himself the Skrullian Skymaster, and revealing his true origin to Doctor Spectrum, Skymax rejoined the Squadron Supreme and settled with them on Utopia Isle.<ref>\'\'Squadron Supreme: New World Order\'\' (September 1998)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nSk\'ym\'x possesses superhuman abilities similar to the [[Super-Skrull]] from [[Earth-616]] and also possesses the Skrull\'s innate racial ability to shape-shift. In Earth-712\'s universe the Skrull Empire was destroyed, so it\'s possible that Sk\'ym\'x\' powers were not amplified in the same manner as the powers of the Super-Skrull. He is also an excellent hand-to-hand fighter, an accomplished pilot and has knowledge of advanced Skrull technology. Sk\'ym\'x has also exhibited telepathy.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Skrullian_Skymaster_%28Earth-712%29 Skrullian Skymaster] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Sk\'ym\'x_%28Earth-712%29 Skrullian Skymaster] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Squadron Supreme}}\n{{Skrull}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Gruenwald]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1985]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can stretch themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Skrull]]'

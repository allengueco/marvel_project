In his first recorded appearance, Jerry learned that radio station WWLX was really a front for Nazi Fifth Columnists who were transmitting secret messages hidden in music. Learning that they were targeting his girlfriend Eileen Conroy, a newspaper reporter, Jerry foiled their operation as the Thunderer. In order to protect his secret identity, Jerry acted like a meek weakling while in his civilian guise.<ref>\'\'Daring Mystery Comics\'\' #7</ref> Thunderer later uncovered the machinations of the hideously deformed dwarf named Gore who hated beautiful people so much that he rigged Morse Code death traps that killed his victims over the radio. The Thunderer smashed up his operation and Gore was killed in a house fire that broke out due to faulty wiring in his equipment.<ref>\'\'Daring Mystery Comics\'\' #8</ref>\n\nThunderer\'s activities were far and few between due to the limitations his position with the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] provided in giving him leads to criminal or spy activities. The Thunderer briefly changed his name (but not his costume) to the Black Avenger. In the fall of 1942, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] caught a Nazi spy that resembled Jerry and convinced him to go undercover to try and expose the spy ring that was sending defense secrets back to Nazi Germany. As the Black Avenger, Jerry managed to round up the Nazis including their leader Kurt Weidner and turn him over to justice<ref>\'\'All-Winners Comics\'\' #6</ref>\n\nAlongside a number of other heroes, the Thunderer participated in an air drop on a Nazi stronghold.<ref>\'\'Marvels\'\' #1</ref>\n\nThe Thunderer attended a reunion of World War II costumed heroes.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #442</ref>\n\nIn 1943, the Black Avenger was among a number of heroes who were slain by the [[Cosmic Cube]]-wielding [[Red Skull]] and impaled on a massive wall.<ref>\'\'Avengers/Invaders\'\' #10</ref> However, the Cosmic Cube was recovered by Private Paul Anslen who resurrected all the slain heroes who aided the combined efforts of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] and the time displaced [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] and [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]. When Red Skull was defeated, the heroes used the Cosmic Cube to wipe out the Black Avenger\'s memories of the event to preserve history/<ref>\'\'Avengers/Invaders\'\' #12</ref>\n\nDuring the "Last Days" part of the \'\'[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\'\' storyline, Thunderer is seen as a resident of Valhalla Villas (a retirement home for ex-heroes and ex-villains in Miami). He was temporarily de-aged during the Incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.<ref>\'\'Ant-Man: Last Days\'\' #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThunderer is a good hand-to-hand combatant.\n\nDue to the construction of his costume, Thunderer is capable of deafening people or leveling buildings with his sonic scream.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n[[Image:Sixfightagain.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Thunderer (far left) along with the other five "Forgotten Warriors" as seen in \'\'[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]\'\'.]]\n* The Thunderer appeared in the five-part \'\'[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]\'\' episode "[[Six Forgotten Warriors]]", voiced by [[Hansford Rowe]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} In this version, the Thunderer\'s powers are the result of an attempt at recreating the process that empowered Captain America and that special rings were needed to activate them. During World War II, the Thunderer fought alongside Captain America, [[Black Marvel]], [[Destroyer (Marvel Comics)|Destroyer]], [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]], and [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]]. After Captain America "sacrificed" his life to stop the Red Skull from activating the Doomsday machine, Thunderer and the others took possession of the keys and retired. In the modern day, the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] led the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] (consisting of [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], and [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]) in trying to gather the keys, and hunted down each of the "Six Forgotten Warriors". The Thunderer was the last one to be located. Ironically, he had stayed close to the base determined to guard it while disguised as a homeless man. Thunderer later joined the others in fighting Kingpin\'s forces and later Red Skull\'s forces and then he helped the other American Warriors defeating giant robots controlled by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] at the UN Building.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-thunderer/4005-46883/ Thunderer] at Comic Vine\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/t/thunderer.htm Thunderer] at International Hero\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=9724|title=Thunderer}}\n\n{{GoldenAge}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1942]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Golden Age superheroes]]\n[[Category:Timely Comics characters]]'

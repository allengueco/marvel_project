The character is usually depicted as an ally of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. The character first appeared in \'\'[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]\'\' Vol. 2, Issue 37 in an inanimate state suspended in tank of gelatin. Elsie-Dee is a [[Sentience|sentient]] automaton or android. Her name is a pun on [[LCD]], indicating her artificial origins.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nElsie-Dee was created along with her counterpart, [[Albert (comics)|Albert]] (a robot double of Wolverine), by [[Donald Pierce]]. These [[Android (robot)|android]]s were designed to kill Wolverine. The Wolverine double was to act as the bait and Elsie-Dee (who outwardly appears to be a 5-year-old girl) was supposed to trap Wolverine in a burning building where she would detonate with sufficient force to kill him.\n\nThe plan fails because one of Pierce\'s [[Reavers (comics)|henchmen]], [[Bonebreaker]], accidentally gives Elsie-Dee the maximum artificial intelligence one of Pierce\'s automatons was capable of, instead of the intended intellect of a 5-year-old. As a result, Elsie-Dee eventually finds a way to defuse her detonation sequence. She also enhances the primitive intelligence of her counterpart, giving him intelligence beyond even hers. They meet and battle Wolverine in the skies over New York. She and her counterpart decide that he was a noble person and did not deserve to die and consequently abandon their mission.\n\nAt one point Elsie-Dee is responsible for the reviving of Sabretooth. The murderous mutant had been left for dead in the sewers and her casual misstep forced his neck back into place, allowing his healing factor to finish the job.\n\nThe two robots risk their existences several times for each other and for Wolverine. At some point they travel in time and have several adventures, eventually gaining an AI stealth bomber and the companionship of the \'Hunter in Darkness\'. Hunter is a white-haired wolf-like creature whom Wolverine twice rescues from confinement, which Elsie-Dee dubs "Puppy".<ref>"Wolverine" vol 2" #53 (April 1992)</ref>\n\nThe trio help stop the murderous \'\'Adversary\'\' hundreds of years ago in the wilds of North America. Albert gains a leadership role with local Indians. They live there for some time and \'Puppy\' leaves his new friends to go live with his own kind.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' #86 (October 1994)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThough appearing to be a 5-year-old girl, Elsie-Dee had abilities far exceeding her appearance. She was very strong, could interface directly with computers, and had an intellect greater than her designer, Donald Pierce, who was himself a genius in the field of robotics.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn \'\'[[Exiles (comic book)|Exiles]]\'\' #85 the [[Timebroker]] gathered multiple teams &ndash; each full of Wolverines &ndash; to finish the repairing of the broken realities. The last team he gathered consisted a version of Albert and Elsie-Dee from Earth-50211. The first mission of the team was to kill an evil [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] (female) who melded with that world\'s Wolverine, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] (female), Scarlet Warlock (male [[Scarlet Witch]]), and [[Mesmero]], and already captured (and manipulated) dozens of Wolverines from the previous teams. When they\'ve arrived they were ambushed immediately and both of them were captured, as well as two of their teammates.<ref>\'\'Exiles\'\' #85 (Aug 23, 2006)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\nElsie Dee is a character in the video game \'[[Wolverine: Adamantium Rage]]\'.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/albert-elsie-dee UncannyXmen.net Character Profile on Albert & Elsie-Dee]\n\n{{Wolverine}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Larry Hama]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Marc Silvestri]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Robot superheroes]]'

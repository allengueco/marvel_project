Created by [[Jim Starlin]], the character first appeared in \'\'[[Iron Man (comic book)|The Invincible Iron Man]]\'\' #55 (February 1973).\n\nThe character\'s origin story relates that Arthur Douglas was a human whose family was attacked and killed by the [[supervillain]] [[Thanos]]. Needing a champion to combat Thanos, the being known as [[Kronos (comics)|Kronos]] took Arthur\'s spirit and placed it in a powerful new body, and Drax the Destroyer was born. Drax\'s powers included enhanced strength and resilience, flight, and the ability to project energy blasts from his hands. The character often battled Thanos, and on occasion the [[superhero]]es [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Adam Warlock]]. He was also a member of the group known as the [[Infinity Watch]].\n\nIn 2004, the character lost his flight and energy blasts, and a portion of his strength and resilience. This version of the character played a role in the [[fictional crossover|crossover]] comic book storylines "[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]" and "[[Annihilation: Conquest]]", and became a member of the relaunched [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].\n\nDrax has been featured in a variety of associated Marvel merchandise, including [[animation|animated]] [[television series]], action figures, and [[video game]]s. He is portrayed by [[Dave Bautista]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], making his first appearance in the 2014 film \'\'[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]\'\' and reprising his role in its 2017 sequel \'\'[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]\'\'. He also reprised his role in the 2018 film \'\'[[Avengers: Infinity War]]\'\' and will again for the fourth [[Untitled Avengers film|Avengers film]].<ref name="Dave Bautista - IMDb">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1176985/ |title=Dave Bautista - IMDb | access-date=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nDrax first appeared in \'\'[[Iron Man (comic book)|The Invincible Iron Man]]\'\' #55 (February 1973), and was created by [[Jim Starlin]] with the help of writer [[Mike Friedrich]].  He had a recurring role in \'\'[[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]\'\', beginning with issue #27 (July 1973).  He also appeared in \'\'[[Adam Warlock|Warlock]]\'\' #10 (December 1975), \'\'Iron Man\'\' #88 (July 1976), \'\'Warlock\'\' #15 (November 1976), \'\'Logan\'s Run\'\' #6 (June 1977), \'\'[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]\'\' #314 (December 1981), and \'\'[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\'\' #219 (May 1982), before being killed by [[Moondragon]] in \'\'Avengers\'\' #220 (June 1982).\n\nStarlin resurrected Drax in \'\'[[Silver Surfer]]\'\' vol 3 #35 (1990), and he had a recurring role until issue 50. After appearing in \'\'[[The Infinity Gauntlet]]\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x936 (1991), he was featured in \'\'[[Warlock and the Infinity Watch]]\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x9342 (1992\xe2\x80\x931995) as a member of the titular team, the [[Infinity Watch]].

After a follow up appearance in \'\'Nova\'\' vol 4 #4\xe2\x80\x937 (2007) and the 2008 "[[Annihilation: Conquest]]" storyline, he was featured as a team member in the 2008 relaunch of [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], and appeared in the 25 issue series of the same name. The character had a small role in \'\'[[The Thanos Imperative]]\'\' #1\xe2\x80\x933 (2010), in which he was killed.\n\nThe character reappeared in \'\'[[Avengers Assemble (comics)|Avengers Assemble]]\'\' issues #4\xe2\x80\x938 (June\xe2\x80\x93October 2012), with no reference to his death.

He is rechristened "Drax the Destroyer", and his sole purpose is to kill Thanos.

After Drax recovers, he and Moondragon journey through space in search of knowledge.<ref name="Thor314"/> Eventually, they come upon the planet Ba-Banis, a world of humanoid aliens caught in a vast civil war. Moondragon uses her mental powers to quell the conflict and then decides to set herself up as the world\'s goddess.

The ship crashes in Alaska, and Drax attacks the others to keep them from harming innocent lives.<ref name="Draxmini1"/> He mistakes a young girl named Cammi for his daughter, and tries to protect her from Paibok. Drax appears to be killed, but a slimmer, smarter Drax emerges from the larger shell of the dead body.<ref name="Draxmini3"/> When a second prison ship arrives to recapture the prisoners, both Drax and Cammi are arrested.<ref name="Draxmini4"/>\n\nSurviving [[Annihilus]]\' attack on the intergalactic prison known as the [[Kyln]], Drax and Cammi team up with the last member of the Xandarian [[Nova Corps]], [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Richard Rider]].

Drax helps to free a captive [[Galactus]], who teleports Moondragon and Drax to a far-off planet to spare them from his wrath on the Annihilation Wave.<ref name="Annihilation5"/> Afterwards, Moondragon says Drax just "disappeared". Cammi is later seen, alive, allied with one of Thanos\' powerful, miniature assistants.<ref name="Annihilation6"/>\n\nWhen the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] invade the [[Kree]] home-world, Drax is assimilated as a "select" of the Phalanx hive mind. They dispatch him, along with [[Gamora]], to apprehend Nova, who had fled the planet.<ref name="Novav4no7"/> Following Nova to Kvch, the home planet the [[Technarchy]] (parental race of the Phalanx), Drax and Gamora are freed from the Phalanx by the Technarch Tyro. Together they return to Hala where they help in the defeat of [[Ultron]].<ref name="AnnihilationC6"/>\n\n===Guardians of the Galaxy===\n{{Main|Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)}}\n[[Star-Lord]] recruits Drax for the new [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref name="GotGv2no1"/> The Guardians are forced to ally themselves with a resurrected Thanos and travel into an alternate reality known as the "Cancerverse".<ref name="ThanosImp1"/> While experiencing a bout of madness, Drax attacks Thanos and is killed.<ref name="ThanosImp3"/> Drax later reappears with the Guardians on Earth without reference to his death.<ref name="AAv2no4"/><ref name="AAv2no5"/>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDrax\'s initial incarnation\'s powers included superhuman strength, stamina and resistance to physical injury as well the ability to project concussive blasts of cosmic energy from his hands. He could also travel at high speeds in [[outer space]] and [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] without air, food, or water. Drax also had telepathy,<ref>"[[Iron Man]]" Vol 1 #55 (February 1973)</ref> having used it to engage [[Thanos]] in a psychic battle and stalemating him mind to mind.<ref>"Captain Marvel" Vol 1 #28</ref> \n\nAfter his resurrection, his physical capabilities are greatly enhanced beyond their original levels but he suffered severe mental disability in his new incarnation.<ref name="SSv3no35"/> Instead of his telepathy which enabled him to track Thanos across vast distances, he now possessed the ability to sense either him or other beings who have been in recent contact with Thanos, alongside a precognitive ability to sense when beings will be in contact with Thanos in the near future. For a time, Drax possessed the [[Infinity Gems|Power Gem]] that had the potential to grant him superhuman physical and energy manipulation powers with no feasible limit. However, because of his severely-reduced intellect, he lacked the mental capacity and imagination to use the gem for anything other than bolstering his physical strength. While possessing the gem, Drax\'s strength has been compared with that of the merged incarnation of the [[Hulk (comics)#Merged Hulk/The Professor|Hulk]], but lacking the latter\'s rage-fueled potential.\n\nJust prior to the 2006 "Annihilation" mini-series and continuing through the present, Drax undergoes a physical change, resulting in a much-smaller physical form, his superhuman, physical powers greatly reduced to a level comparable to those of his original form and the loss of his energy projection, flight and most any residual psionic capabilities; having just enough to glean the moments of his demise from Cammi.<ref name="Draxmini3"/> However, his intellect has returned to its original level, and he has taken a liking to using knives in battle.<ref name="Draxmini4"/><ref name="AnnNova4"/> At least temporarily, he had the ability to pass through Thanos\'s force field; his power levels seem to increase the closer he is to Thanos.<ref name="Annihilation4"/> He could also heal at an accelerated rate and had senses sharp enough to tell humans from aliens by smell,<ref>"Annihilation: Nova" Vol 1 #1</ref> root out a skrull in disguise and detect when energy weapons were about to go off.<ref>"Guardians of the Galaxy" Vol 2 #5</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Drax appears in the episode "Learning Curve" of the \'\'[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]\'\' animated series, voiced by [[Norm Spencer]]. He is a [[cyborg]], stated to have an organic brain in a mechanical body, and is a companion of [[Mentor (A\'lars)|Mentor]].\n* Drax the Destroyer appears in the \'\'[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]\'\' episode "Guardians of the Galaxy", voiced by [[David Sobolov]]. He is seen as a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. In the episode "The Return of the Guardians of the Galaxy", Drax the Destroyer was seen recuperating on the Guardians\' spaceship when they land on Earth at the time when Titus and the Chitauri target Nova\'s helmet. Drax the Destroyer recovers in time to help fight Titus\'s forces.\n* Drax the Destroyer appears in the \'\'[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]\'\' episode "Guardians and Spaceknights", voiced again by David Sobolov.\n* Sobolov reprises his role as Drax in \'\'[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]\'\' episode "It\'s a Wonderful Smash",<ref name="It\'s a Wonderful Smash">{{cite episode|title=It\'s a Wonderful Smash|series=Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=25|airdate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> and "Guardians of the Galaxy".\n* Drax appears in \'\'[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]\'\' episodes 24 and 25, voiced by Yoshinori Sonobe.\n* Sobolov reprises his role as Drax in the \'\'[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]\'\' animated series.<ref>September 27, 2015, "[http://www.cosmicbooknews.com/content/watch-david-sobolov-guardians-galaxy-drax-interview Watch: David Sobolov Guardians of the Galaxy Drax Interview]", CosmicBookNews (accessed October 7, 2015)</ref> It was shown in the "Origins" episode that Drax surrendered himself to the Nova Corps in exchange that the aliens with him that were abducted by Ronan the Accuser are returned safely to their planets.

He first meets the other Guardians of the Galaxy in prison, including [[Gamora]], whom he holds responsible for his family\'s deaths because she is a daughter of Thanos. She tells him that she was raised by Thanos only after he slaughtered her own family, and bears no loyalty to him, and the two join [[Peter Quill]] in escaping prison in order to confront Ronan, whom they eventually kill. A recurring gag throughout the film is Drax\'s inability to understand metaphors because Drax\'s species is, according to [[Rocket Raccoon|Rocket]], completely literal. Bautista reprised his role as Drax in its 2017 sequel \'\'[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]\'\' and again in \'\'[[Avengers: Infinity War]]\'\' (2018).<ref name="Bautista">{{cite tweet|date=January 22, 2017 |first=Dave|last=Bautista|authorlink=Dave Bautista|user=DaveBautista|title=Welp!!!

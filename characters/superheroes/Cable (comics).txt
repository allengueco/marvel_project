The character first appeared as a newborn infant in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' #201 (Jan. 1986) created by writer [[Chris Claremont]], while Cable\'s adult identity was created by writer [[Louise Simonson]] and artist/co-writer [[Rob Liefeld]], and first appeared in \'\'[[New Mutants|The New Mutants]]\'\' #87 (March 1990).\n\nNathan Summers is the biological son of the X-Men member [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] (Scott Summers) and [[Madelyne Pryor]] ([[Jean Grey]]\'s clone), the [[Sibling#half|half brother]] of [[Rachel Summers]] and [[Nate Grey]], and the genetic template for [[Stryfe]]. He is from a possible future timeline, having been transported as an infant to the future, where he grew into a warrior, before returning to the present.\n\n[[Josh Brolin]] portrays Cable in the [[X-Men (film series)|\'\'X-Men\'\' film series]], beginning with \'\'[[Deadpool 2]]\'\'.<ref name=HollywoodReporter>{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/deadpool-2-josh-brolin-play-cable-993232|title=Josh Brolin to Play Cable in \'Deadpool 2\' (Exclusive)|accessdate=April 12, 2017|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n===Creation===\nNathan Christopher Charles Summers is the son of Scott Summers (aka [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]), and [[Madeline Pryor]] (who was [[Inferno (comics)|later revealed]] to be a clone of [[Jean Grey]]).

He does not appear anywhere in the issue\'s story, but the "next issue" teaser. This was followed by a full appearance in \'\'The New Mutants\'\' #87 (March 1990). At first, Cable was not intended to be the adult version of Nathan Summers, but was created as a result of unrelated editorial concerns. Editor [[Bob Harras]] wanted to "shake things up" for the book, and felt a new leader was needed, one distinct from the perennial X-Men leader and the New Mutants\' first mentor, [[Professor X]]. The book\'s writer, [[Louise Simonson]], thought a military leader would be a good idea, and Harras tasked the book\'s artist, [[Rob Liefeld]], to conceptualize the character. Harras may also have suggested the character\'s bionic eye. Both Simonson and Liefeld each separately conceived of the leader being a time traveler from the future. Liefeld chose the name Cable for the character.<ref name=CBR4.2.09>{{Cite web|author=Cronin, Brian | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/04/02/comic-book-legends-revealed-201/ | title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #201 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=April 2, 2009}}</ref> Liefeld explains the creation of the character:\n\n{{quote|I was given a directive to create a new leader for the New Mutants.

Issue #6 (Dec. 1993) confirmed the character to be Nathan Christopher Summers, the son of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] (Scott Summers) and [[Madelyne Pryor]] ([[Jean Grey]]\'s clone) who had been taken to the future in \'\'X-Factor\'\' #68 (July 1991), introduced by writer [[Chris Claremont]], and appeared in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' #201 (Jan. 1986).

In the future, Mother Askani, a time-displaced [[Rachel Summers]], pulled the minds of Scott and Jean into the future where, as "Slym" and "Redd", they raised Cable for twelve years.

He gains a power level similar to his [[Nate Grey]] counterpart from [[The Age of Apocalypse]] reality and tries to use them to force the people of the world to live in peace. Using his powers at this magnitude also means that he will die due to the vast power being too much for his body to continuously maintain. He tries to carry out his plans quickly, defeating the X-Men, Six Pack and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] with little effort. They turn the tide of the battle on Cable by enlisting the aid of the [[Silver Surfer]]. Cable and the Silver Surfer battled, destroying buildings and other structures but were immediately rebuilt by Cable\'s vast telekinesis. All the while Cable tried to explain his good intentions to the Surfer with no avail. Although Cable destroyed his board and briefly held his own against the Surfer, he was ultimately defeated when the Surfer destroyed Cable\'s arm.{{issue|date=July 2016}} Around the same time period, Cable becomes a member of a team of [[X-Men]] that consists of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Lady Mastermind]], and [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]].{{Issue|date=July 2010}} In preparation for [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]], Cable seemingly died when he detonated Providence to prevent [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] from stealing his database,{{Issue|date=July 2010}} causing the series to focus mostly on Deadpool for the next six or so issues.

This version of Cable possessed his trademark metal arm but it is said to be a bionic construct rather than a result of the techno-organic virus. He is never shown to be telepathic, though he does use telekinesis in one episode. He is also depicted as coming from the year 3999, where he leads an army in a desperate war against the forces of the immortal villain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Cyclops\' future paternity to Cable is implied in the second part of the episode "Time Fugitives" after Jean Gray telepathically read Cable\'s mind.

Deadpool forms the X-Force team to stop him, but both sides are at an impasse when Russell teams up with Juggernaut. Cable decides to team up with X-Force to take down the two threats, but allows Wade the chance to redeem Russell before the kid becomes a murderer. Wade sacrifices himself when Cable tries to shoot Russell, causing Russell to reject his future as a villain which saves Cable\'s family. In return, Cable uses his last charge on his time-traveling device to travel to the past to prevent himself from killing Wade while still allowing Russell to have his change of heart at the cost of Cable losing the chance to return home to his family, Cable concluding that he will remain in the present to create a better future for his family.\n\n===Video games===\n* Cable appears as a playable character in the [[fighting game]] \'\'[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes|Marvel vs. Capcom 2]]\'\', voiced again by Lawrence Bayne.

In the funeral scene following the Prison 42 incident, Cable is featured amongst the missing and presumed deceased heroes, indicating that he was absorbed into the Fold. Cable was later added as a playable character in the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] versions of the game via [[downloadable content]], and was part of the initial roster of heroes in the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and PC versions.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://marvelultimatealliance.marvel.com/#/Characters/Cable | title=Marvel Ultimate Alliance Characters: Cable | work=Marvel.com | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318200922/http://marvelultimatealliance.marvel.com/#/Characters/Cable | archivedate=2009-03-18 | df= }}</ref>\n* Cable makes a cameo appearance in Deadpool\'s ending in \'\'[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]\'\'.

In the game, Cable time-travels to Genosha to give Deadpool a dire warning, but bores Deadpool into killing himself. He later reprograms a Sentinel bot to take Deadpool to Magneto\'s citadel, which goes haywire. He later helps Deadpool recover the souls of dead mutants and deliver them to [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]].

What I was stealing from was \xe2\x80\x93 really only two key designs of Rob\'s \xe2\x80\x93 the design of Cable. I hated it. I felt like it looked like they just threw up everything on the character \xe2\x80\x93 the scars, the thing going on with his eye, the arm, and what\'s with all the guns?

The character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and writer-artist [[Jack Kirby]], first appearing in \'\'[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' #52 ([[cover-date]]d July 1966) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. Black Panther\'s real name is \'\'\'T\'Challa\'\'\', king and protector of the fictional African nation of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]]. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T\'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.\n\nBlack Panther is the first superhero of African descent<!--People of African descent include Africans. This is a stronger statement than simply saying "first African superhero".--> in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early [[African American]] superheroes such as Marvel Comics\' the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] (1969), [[Luke Cage]] (1972) and [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] (1973), or [[DC Comics]]\' [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] in the role of [[Green Lantern]] (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by [[White Tiger (Kasper Cole)|Kasper Cole]], a multiracial [[New York City]] [[New York City Police Department|police officer]]. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of White Tiger and become an ally to T\'Challa. The role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda is also given to T\'Challa\'s sister [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]] for a short time.\n\nBlack Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films and video games. The character is portrayed in live action by [[Chadwick Boseman]] in the 2016 film \'\'[[Captain America: Civil War]]\'\', and the 2018 films \'\'[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]\'\' and \'\'[[Avengers: Infinity War]]\'\', set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].\n\nIn 2011, Black Panther was ranked 51st overall on [[IGN]]\'s "Top 100 Comic Books Heroes" list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/lists/comic-book-heroes/51 |title=IGN\'s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes: #51 Black Panther |website=IGN}}</ref>\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\n===Name===\nThe Black Panther\'s name predates the October 1966 founding of the [[Black Panther Party]], though not the black panther logo of the party\'s predecessor, the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee#Lowndes County Freedom Organization|Lowndes County Freedom Organization]] (LCFO), nor the [[Racial segregation|segregated]] [[World War II]] [[761st Tank Battalion (United States)|Black Panthers Tank Battalion]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/11/27/comic-book-legends-revealed-183/|title= Comic Book Legends Revealed #183 |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |last= Cronin|first= Brian |date= December 5, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Yuen/BPP_logo.html |title= Origin of the Black Panther Party logo |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |work= H.K.

T\'Challa (the title character) is the enigmatic ruler of a technologically advanced, slightly xenophobic African nation, so he acts like it". Gross applauded the title\'s "endless wit, sharp characterization, narrative sophistication and explosive splash panels".<ref>{{Cite news| first=Joe|last= Gross |first2= Jeff |last2=Salamon | url= | title=Five comic books you (or your kids)* should be reading | publisher=[[Austin American-Statesman]] | date=May 30, 2002 }}</ref>\n\nComics reviewer and journalist Mike Sangiacomo, however, criticized the narrative structure. "Christopher Priest\'s fractured writing is getting on my nerves.

"I appreciate the notion of seeing the Black Panther through the eyes of an Everyman, but the Panther is almost relegated to secondary status in his own book. And Ross\' narration jumps around in time so much that I feel like his boss, who, in trying to get Ross to tell her what has happened, complains: \'This is like watching "[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]" in rewind.

He rejoins the team in the episode "Behold ... The Vision!" after a battle with [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. He was thought dead in the episode "Operation Galactic Storm" when he drove a Kree ship into the sun. However, just as the ship is about to crash, Panther uses its teleporter to take him to a Kree ship on the other side of the wormhole. On the Kree ship, he steals a smaller ship, and follows the Avengers down to Hala. Panther rescued Iron Man, Vision, Hawkeye, and Thor from a monster, and helped them free the others.

After becoming Black Panther and helping Captain America to take out Crossbones, T\'Challa makes off with Captain America\'s shield claiming that it was stolen property. This leads [[Captain America]] to bring [[Iron Man]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] in order to reclaim it. During the confrontation, Black Panther claims that [[Howard Stark]] stole vibranium in order to make Captain America\'s shield. To make matters worse, Ulysses Klaue appears where he makes off with Captain America\'s shield upon using a sound attack on the group. Both sides work to find Klaue as Captain America states to Black Panther that T\'Chaka gave the vibranium for Stark to make into Captain America\'s shield. Tracking him to a hideout in the [[Himalayas]], the Avengers and Black Panther engage Klaue in an armor made out of vibranium. With a special tactic, the Avengers and Black Panther were able to knock Klaue out of the armor as Black Panther plans to make Ulysses Klaue answer for his crimes. With Klaue\'s vibranium armor in Wakandan custody, Black Panther changes his opinion of the Avengers and is offered reserve membership into the group.

The character was first introduced as a supporting character in \'\'[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]\'\' and appeared again in the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series \'\'[[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]]\'\', as the son of Eric Masterson, the featured character of both series. Kevin Masterson was later re-introduced in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] series \'\'[[A-Next]]\'\', as the superhero \'\'\'[[Thunderstrike (comics)|Thunderstrike]]\'\'\', a theme which would be revisited in the [[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]] of Marvel Comics in the eponymous limited series.<ref>[http://insidepulse.com/2010/11/24/spoiler-warnings-new-thunderstrike-revealed-in-thunderstrike-1-by-tom-defalco/]</ref><ref>http://www.comicvine.com/news/comic-book-reviews-for-the-week-of-112410/142598/</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nKevin Masterson was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]], first appearing in \'\'Thor\'\' vol. 1 #392 in June 1988 as the son of the original hero known as Thunderstrike, Eric Masterson. He would continue to appear in a supporting role in \'\'Thor\'\' and spin-off series \'\'Thunderstrike\'\'.\n\nThe character would be re-imagined in \'\'[[What If (comics)|What If]]\'\' vol. 2 #105, appearing for the first time as a new version of Thunderstrike. An origin for Kevin Masterson as Thunderstrike would appear in the follow-up MC2 series \'\'A-Next\'\' #1, where he would continue to be featured, as part of the ensemble cast of characters. He would also appear in the MC2 series \'\'[[Last Hero Standing]]\'\' and sequel \'\'[[Last Planet Standing]]\'\'; as well as, the follow-up series \'\'Avengers Next.\'\'\n\nThe use of Kevin Masterson as a legacy version of Thunderstrike was a theme revisited during the [[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]. It was announced that the character would return in a new five-issue miniseries by co-creators Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz in November 2010.<ref>http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2010/08/defalco-and-frenz-to-revive-thunderstrike/</ref> Promotionals leading into the event began in August depicting the mace stating "One will rise..." and "The World Still Needs Heroes."<ref>http://marvel.com/news/all.13544.the_world_still_needs_heroes</ref>  The first issues received generally positive reviews, lauding the premise, characterization and plotting.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=2911</ref> By series end the book was praised for plotting, diaglogue, and characterization, with the contemporization of a classic character into timeless.<ref>http://www.majorspoilers.com/review-thunderstrike-5-of-5</ref>\n\nThunderstrike appeared in \'\'Fear Itself: The Home Front\'\'.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===MC2===\nKevin Masterson is granted the mace of his deceased father by [[Edwin Jarvis]], the Avengers\' butler, per his father\'s will. The mace is stolen from Kevin and even comes into the possession of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], who had created a spell to tap the dormant power within the mace. Kevin leaps into the midst of the spell, absorbing the mace and the magic it contains. He becomes his own version of Thunderstrike and a founding member of a new version of the [[A-Next|Avengers]]. \n\nAs the series continues, Thunderstrike\'s biggest challenge comes when the Avengers travel to a dark parallel dimension, where he encounters a dark version of his father. The alternate Eric Masterson recognized Thunderstrike as Kevin, who learns that in this reality, he, not Eric, has died. The alternate Eric and Kevin bonded, and once the Avengers defeat the dark dimension\'s ruler, Kevin stays behind to be with his "father".\n\nKevin returns to his home reality, and rejoins the Avengers to aid in the battle with Seth.<ref>\'\'Spider-Girl\'\' #58</ref> When [[Galactus]] destroys [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], Thunderstrike seemingly loses his powers in \'\'[[Last Planet Standing]]\'\'. He is kidnapped by Ulik and Sylene, daughter of Loki, as part of a plan to restore Asgard;<ref>\'\'Avengers Next\'\' #1</ref> but Kevin Masterson struggles against his captors. Ultimately he is responsible for turning the tables on the villains. [[Thena (MC2)|Thena]], daughter of Thor, who had also taken part in the battle against her cousin, is able to restore Kevin\'s power, allowing him to become Thunderstrike once again.<ref>\'\'Avengers Next\'\' #5</ref>\n\n===\'\'Thunderstrike\'\' (limited series)===\n[[File:Thunderstrike5.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Kevin Masterson as Thunderstrike.]]\nAn embittered adolescent Kevin Masterson is featured in the \'\'Thunderstrike\'\' limited series. The character previously featured as an idealistic child is shown to have anger, behavioral problems, and disillusioned outlook on "spandex-covered glory hounds."  \n\nHe is given his father\'s enchanted mace by [[Captain America|Captain Steve Rogers]]; which to their mutual disappointment triggers no change in the character (although he does receive an open invitation to the [[Avengers Academy]], in which he is later seen arriving on their New Campus in California.<ref>Following \'\'Avengers Academy\'\' #20</ref>).\n\nWhile on his way home, Kevin tries to save a mother and child from a rampaging [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and is transformed into a superhero. Kevin briefly battles the Rhino, and shortly after Kevin is defeated, he realizes that he is in his father\'s body. [[Mangog]], a foe of Thor, resurfaces and threatens [[New York City]]. The young hero teams with Thor, to battle the monster. Kevin accepts his new identity as Thunderstrike, along with a new image, and continues his adventures under the mentorship of [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Brunnhilde the Valkyrie]].\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\'\' storyline, Thunderstrike ends up teleported onto a station in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with [[Amadeus Cho]], [[X-23]], [[Anya Corazon|Spider-Girl]], and [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Power Man]]. They end up fighting a bunch of samurai Shark Men.<ref>\'\'Fear Itself: The Home Front\'\' #5-7</ref>\n\nKevin briefly appeared as part of the new class of students when the [[Avengers Academy]] moves to the former headquarters of the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>\'\'Avengers Academy\'\' #21 (Nov. 2011)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n===MC2===\nKevin has the ability to change from his normal form into the superhuman Thunderstrike. As Thunderstrike, he has the powers contained within the [[Thunderstrike (comics)#Item|mace of the same name]]. Thunderstrike is superhumanly strong and durable. He can generate explosive bursts of sonic force (his "thunderbolts") from his hands, and direct them as blasts of force, or focus the energy into his fists to deliver super-strong punches. Thunderstrike can direct his blasts downwards to launch himself into the air and, while he cannot fly, can propel himself to great distances. He even learned how to modulate the frequency of his sonic energies to shatter objects just by touching them, without harming nearby people.\n\n===\'\'Thunderstrike\'\' (limited series)===\nKevin\'s demonstrated powers in the limited series are the same as his father\'s, including the reversion to his normal state if he is separated from Thunderstrike for over sixty seconds. He did not use the ability to fire energy blasts from the mace in the limited series. Thanks to tutoring by the valkyrie Brunnehilde, he is also capable of changing his appearance as Thunderstrike, finally choosing a form which is a modified version of his normal self.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Kevin_Masterson_%28Earth-616%29 Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson)] at Marvel Wiki\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=4655|title=Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson)}}\n\n{{MC2}}\n{{Thor}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Ron Frenz]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from parallel universes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics 2]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]'

The character exists in Marvel\'s main [[shared universe]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]].\n\n==Publication history==\nDevil-Slayer was created by [[David Anthony Kraft]] and [[Rich Buckler]]. According to Kraft, Devil-Slayer was a tweaked version of the character he and Buckler created in \'\'[[Demon Hunter (comics)|Demon Hunter]]\'\' (1975) for [[Atlas/Seaboard Comics]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=DeAngelo|first=Daniel|date=July 2013|title=The Not-Ready-For-Super-Team Players: A History of the Defenders |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65|page=10 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|quote=Devil-Slayer was a character named Demon Hunter that Rich Buckler and I did for Atlas Comics. ... Rich later said he was thinking of bring him back, so we kicked it around and changed the character a little.}}</ref> On his first day back in the Marvel Comics offices after the collapse of Atlas/Seaboard, Kraft bumped into Buckler in the hall and the two discussed bringing back Demon Hunter. Kraft recounted, "I changed his costume colors, Rich changed his costume design a little bit, we changed his name, of course - but if you look at his backstory it\'s a direct continuation from the Atlas issue."<ref name="back71">{{cite journal |last=Buttery|first=Jarrod|title=Ready for the Spotlight|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|pages=10-11 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> The character first appeared in \'\'[[Marvel Spotlight]]\'\' #33 (April 1977). Plans for Devil-Slayer to star in additional issues of \'\'Marvel Spotlight\'\' were halted by the series\'s cancellation, with Devil-Slayer\'s debut being the final issue.<ref name="back71"/> However, shortly after he was added to the lineup of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].\n\nThe character subsequently appeared in \'\'The Defenders\'\' #58\xe2\x80\x9360 (April\xe2\x80\x93June 1978), #97\xe2\x80\x93101 (July\xe2\x80\x93November 1981), \'\'Marvel Team-Up\'\' #111 (November 1981), \'\'The Defenders\'\' #103\xe2\x80\x93104 (January\xe2\x80\x93February 1982), \'\'Marvel Graphic Novel\'\' #1&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 \'The Death of Captain Marvel\' (April 1982), \'\'Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions\'\' #1 (June 1982), #3 (August 1982), and \'\'The Defenders\'\' #110 (August 1982), which was a Devil-Slayer solo story cited by writer [[J.

It was titled \'\'[[Dead of Night (comics)|Dead of Night]] Featuring Devil-Slayer\'\' and starred a new Devil-Slayer, a man named Danny Sylva. Sylva is the great-nephew of Payne, the original Devil-Slayer. This series is written by horror novelist [[Brian Keene]] with art by [[Chris Samnee]].<ref>Richards, Dave [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16622 WW Philly: Devil-Slayer Returns in "Dead of Night"], [[Comic Book Resources]], May 31, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080602-maxs-devil-slayer.html Warren Simons & Brian Keene On Max\'s Devil-Slayer], [[Newsarama]], June 3, 2008</ref>\n\nDevil-Slayer received an entry in the original \'\'[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]\'\' #3, and in the \'\'All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z\'\' #3. (2006)\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nEric Payne was born in Queenstown, Illinois.  He was a member of a demon cult called the [[Agents of Fortune (comics)|Agents of Fortune]], who helped him unlock the psionic potential of his brain and gave him a mystically created dimensional cloak.  He later turned on the cult and, with the aid of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], he battled Vera Gemini and the Xenogesis and helped prevent the cult\'s mystical plans from being realized.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #59\xe2\x80\x9360</ref>\n\nHe assists the Defenders in confronting a cult leader named David. This man had been granted temporary mystical powers by a coalition of [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demons]] known as the \'\'[[Six-Fingered Hand (comics)|Six Fingered Hand]]\'\'. Despite the passing nature of his abilities, Eric\'s wife Cory chose to stay with the cult leader.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #97</ref>\n\nAs the Defenders returned to [[Doctor Strange]]\'s home after this confrontation, they were called into action again by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The town of [[Citrusville]], Florida had vanished, into a gigantic hole resembling a six-fingered hand. Eric and the rest of the group confronted a possessed [[Man-Thing]] and then traveled through dimensional realms in order to find the source of the problem.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #98</ref>\n\nDuring Eric\'s time with the Defenders, he helped confront a host of demons, including [[Balthazar (comics)|Balthazar]], who had taken over the form of an Air Force commander. The Defenders almost died when Balthazar convinced innocent Air Force pilots that they were spies. Though his demon compatriots were eventually sucked back to their own realm, Balthazar somehow stayed on Earth. {{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nStill in the form of the Air Force soldier, he targeted Devil-Slayer personally. Balthazar tricked Devil-Slayer into a bar full of disguised demons where Eric\'s drink was altered, thus removing his psychic powers. Despite this, Devil-Slayer held his own, using his magical accessories to battle the demons successfully. Balthazar and Eric were drawn into the \'\'Borders of the Land of the Dead\'\', where stood many of his Defender allies, now seemingly dead. It was here that Balthazar was seemingly slain again.<ref>\'\'Marvel Comics Presents\'\' #37</ref>\n\nThere are indications he has returned another time but this might be Payne\'s mental instability.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nEric questions his tragic life, and reconciles with his wife, then turns himself in for his past crimes.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #110</ref> He later helps war-torn Potega, but loses his shadow-cloak, and then rededicates himself as a hero.<ref>\'\'Marvel Comics Presents\'\' #46\xe2\x80\x9349</ref>\n\nDevil-Slayer was later remitted to an asylum, where he discovers a shard of the Nexus of Realities, and then becomes Payne with his partner Sorrow.<ref>\'\'Man-Thing\'\' #3\xe2\x80\x934, \'\'Strange Tales\'\' #2</ref>\n\nNighthawk mentioned he had talked to Eric Payne and that he was willing to join a new team of Defenders. However, when Richmond suggested it to Initiative boss Tony Stark, he declined the offer.<ref>\'\'The Last Defenders\'\' #1</ref> Shortly afterwards Eric is seen as a member of the Hawaiian [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] team, the Point Men, serving the team as their "Monster Hunter." When the new [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]] arrives in Hawaii, Devil-Slayer informs him that he has sensed portents of doom all day. When 3-D Man identifies team member Magnitude as a [[Skrull]] impostor, the Skrull attacks and severely wounds the other Point Men, Star Sign and Paydirt. The Skrull is killed, and Devil-Slayer uses his Shadow Cloak to teleport Delroy to [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]] before taking Star Sign and Paydirt to a hospital.<ref>\'\'Avengers: the Initiative\'\' # 14</ref> Devil-Slayer later appears in Utah with the cyborg [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] to aid 3-D Man and the [[Skrull Kill Krew]].<ref>\'\'Avengers: the Initiative\'\' # 17</ref> He spends some time teleporting the Krew and their ever-increasing allies across the country to kill Skrulls who have infiltrated the Initiative teams.<ref>\'\'Avengers: the Initiative\'\' # 18</ref> As forewarned, he runs out of power and faints, leaving the final few confrontations to the speedsters the Krew have recruited.<ref>\'\'Avengers: the Initiative\'\' # 19</ref>\n\nAfter Doctor Strange loses his position as Sorcerer Supreme, Devil-Slayer is one of the many magic users approached by the [[Eye of Agamotto]] as a potential replacement.<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\'#53</ref>\n\nDevil-Slayer (wearing a totally new outfit) is recruited by [[Wonder Man]] (whose ionic energy leaking powers were affecting his judgement) to join his [[Revengers]].<ref>\'\'New Avengers Annual\'\' Vol. 2 #1 (2011)</ref> He and the Revengers were defeated by the three Avengers teams and remanded to The Raft. When he was interrogated, Devil-Slayer stated that he joined the Revengers in order to make a reality where the Avengers were held accountable for their actions.<ref>\'\'Avengers Annual\'\' #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nEric Simon Payne is a trained soldier and hit man, proficient in nearly all forms of hand-to-hand weaponry and an above-average marksman.\n\nAs Devil-Slayer, Payne uses a mystical device called a shadow cloak. The cloak can elongate itself and respond to his mental commands, forming whips and grappling opponents and objects. The inside of the cloak served as a portal to other dimensions. By wrapping himself and/or others in folds of the cloak, Payne can teleport to and from other dimensions and could even teleport limited distances on Earth by entering and exiting at different locations. Time also runs differently inside the cloak, allowing Payne to place injured people in a form of stasis if he so wills.<ref>\'\'Avengers: the Initiative\'\' # 14</ref>\n\nPayne had also developed certain psychic abilities. He possesses a sixth sense that can detect mystical influence on people or creatures, useful for tracking and finding demons. He also had some degree of telekinesis and telepathy, the latter of which he typically used to mask his costume with an illusion of civilian clothes. The nature and extent of Payne\'s current powers remains unrevealed.\n\nPayne could also reach into the folds of the cloak and draw out an endless supply of weapons from any time or place. He typically used melee weapons such as swords, axes or maces but has also removed from it more modern weapons such as automatic rifles and even futuristic weapons such as a plasma rifle. On at least one occasion, he used a staff that conferred upon him a degree of invulnerability and generated energies that he could absorb to enhance his psychic abilities.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Devil-Slayer Devil-Slayer] at Marvel.com\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/devilslayerdef.htm|Devil-Slayer}}\n\n{{Defenders}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by David Anthony Kraft]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Illinois]]\n[[Category:Fictional soldiers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]'

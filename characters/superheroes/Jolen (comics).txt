Jolen confronts Mister Chase, a hired hitman, and is shot in the head.<ref>''Inhumans V'' #11</ref> After a bit of scuffle, Jolen revives, and uses a root to murder the hitman.<ref>''Inhumans V'' #12</ref> From here, Jolen appears to take a darker moral path, threatening and killing several other people.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nIn response to a report of Terrigen crystals in New York City, Jolen is assembled with a team, and leads an assault on the reported owner of the crystals. During the assault, the team is confronted by the [[Fantastic Four]], and are quickly defeated.

Having accomplished their mission, they return to their [[moon]] base.<ref>''Silent War'' #5</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDue to his race, he is gifted with a number of abilities in addition to that of a normal human.

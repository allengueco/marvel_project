He used that super hero identity after joining the \'\'[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\'\' with Wasp, Iron Man, Thor and the Hulk.<ref>\'\'the Avengers\'\' #1</ref> He has also used other aliases like [[Ant-Man]], [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]], [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]], and [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].<ref>\'\'Age of Ultron\'\' #10.A.I.</ref>\n\nAs Goliath, Hank Pym led the Avengers after Captain America left the team. He married his girlfriend, Janet Van Dyne, a.k.a. the wonderful Wasp, and also created the artificial intelligence better known as [[Ultron]].<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #60</ref>\n\nAs Giant-Man, Pym fought villains like the Human Top and Egghead, and many years after, joined the [[Secret Avengers]],  the Avengers A.I. and the Avengers Academy. He also helped Wasp to escape from the Microverse after the "Avengers vs X-Men" conflict. Giant-Man also helped Matt Murdock and his friend Foggy Nelson on many ocasions, and fought his enemy Ultron during the \'\'Rage of Ultron\'\' event.<ref>\'\'Avengers: Rage of Ultron\'\' #1</ref>\n\nAfter seemingly dying during the final battle, Pym surprised everyone when he returned as an amalgamation of flesh and Ultron circuitry and encountered the Uncanny Avengers, later joining the team in his new cybernetic form as Ultron. However, the group didn\'t completely trust him and called the Wasp for help. After the Avengers\' fears proved true and Pym transformed into Ultron completely and fought the Unity Division, destroying Iron Man\'s Hulkbuster armor in the process, the Vision was forced to help the team destroy his \'father\'. However, Ultron was later revealed to still be alive.<ref>\'\'Uncanny Avengers\'\' #13</ref>\n\n===Bill Foster===\n[[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] was Hank Pym\'s successor who originally went by the name Black Goliath.\n\nFoster later died during the \'\'[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]\'\' storyline, where he joined Captain America\'s team as Black Goliath and was killed by [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]].\n\n===Raz Malhotra===\n[[File:razmalhotra.jpg|thumb|right|Raz Malhotra as Giant-Man on the cover of \'\'The Astonishing Ant-Man\'\' #5. Art by Mark Brooks]]\nRaz Malhotra is a computer technician whose former field study was in artificial intelligence at the time when Hank Pym started to rid the world of them. Many companies shut down their A.I.s before Raz could graduate. He started working on a tech-support company called Techbusters in San Francisco. Upon resurfacing following his apparent death, [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]] read Raz\'s dissertion called "Breakthroughs in Moral Paradigms for Artificial Intelligence." Egghead decided to lure him into his lair under the guise of wanting support for his mac book. When Raz Malhotra arrived to Egghead\'s base, Egghead revealed his true intentions of wanting Malhotra to use his knowledge to power up artificial duplicates of the Avengers called the A.I.Vengers he had stolen from Hank Pym. Malhotra repudiated Egghead\'s evil intentions, forcing the villain to use a neural override device to control him. Egghead\'s plans attracted the attention of Hank Pym and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]]. When Raz breaks free from the neural override, he shuts down the A.I.Vengers as Hank Pym knocks out Egghead. Some months later after Hank Pym seemingly perishes in the fight against Ultron, Hank Pym left one of his labs to Scott Lang who sent Raz a present in the form one of the Giant-Man uniforms. It was also revealed that Raz has a boyfriend.<ref>\'\'Ant-Man Annual\'\' Vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\nRaz decides to use the Giant-Man suit to fight [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]], but gets trapped in the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] during the conflict.<ref>\'\'Astonishing Ant-Man\'\' #4</ref>\n\nScott Lang later reunited with Raz and took him to confront [[Power Broker]] at his public promotion of the Hench App 2.0.

She is connected to the Darkforce dimension by means of her consciousness being split between her physical body and a Darkforce representation of same, both symbiotically linked. Darkstar can thus utilize the Darkforce for various purposes. She can cause Darkforce to behave like either matter or energy. Most often she projected it as simple mentally-controlled solid objects possessing the density of steel such as pincers, rings, columns, and spheres, or as beams of concussive force. If Darkstar is rendered unconscious any Darkforce constructs of her making immediately dissipate. Darkstar can [[Teleportation|teleport]] herself and up to three others by opening a portal into the Darkforce dimension and travelling through it. The maximum distance she can teleport has never been revealed. Because crossing the Darkforce dimension disorients her sense of direction, and the light of Earth blinds her for several seconds upon reemergence, traveling in this manner is risky.\n\nDarkstar can levitate herself and fly at subsonic speeds by generating a virtually invisible portal into the Darkforce dimension along the contours of her body without passing through it, then balancing the attractive force of the dimension against that of the Earth\'s gravity. The upper limits of her powers are still unknown.\n\nDarkstar is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by the KGB, and from the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. She is fluent in both [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[English language|English]].\n\nWhile the original Darkstar\'s costume was designed by the Soviet government and was made of a synthetic stretch fabric insulated against the cold, the other two Darkstars had costumes which were composed of Darkforce material.<ref name="WinterGuard"/>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Civil War: House of M===\nDarkstar is seen as a member of the Soviet Super-Soldiers.<ref>\'\'Civil War: House of M\'\' #2</ref>\n\n===Other===\n* On Earth 3470, the native timeline of [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Heather Hudson]] of the dimension-jumping [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], the Soviet Union still exists. Darkstar is part of the Soviet Super-Soldiers.<ref>\'\'Exiles\'\' (vol. 1) #84</ref>\n* An alternate version of Darkstar was shown in yet another universe. She was a member of the Republican Guard, Russia\'s superhuman team, alongside Crimson Dynamo, [[Omega Red]], Gremlin, and the [[Titanium Man]].<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Exiles|Issue = 43|Date = Jan 2005|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Darkstar guest-starred in the \'\'[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]\'\' animated series.

Her strength varies from being able to lift {{convert|800|lb|kg|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} to being able to lift {{convert|25|t|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=in|order=flip}}, depending on her adrenaline levels. Her speed, agility and stamina are also enhanced. However, she can only use her powers for a short time before exhausting herself. When she uses her powers, dark lines appear on her face.<ref>\'\'Morlocks\'\' #1.

In contrast to her comic counterpart her powers do not appear to be as dependent on a temporary surge of adrenaline, the upward limits of her physical strength seem to be higher and she exhibits a super-human level of durability; as she is able to hold her own in hand-to-hand combat with [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Angel_Dust Profile] at Marvel.com\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/angeldust.htm|Angel Dust}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Geoff Johns]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2002]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]'

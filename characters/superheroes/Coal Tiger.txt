While [[Mainframe (comics)|Mainframe]] tried to convince the youth to leave the battle, T\'Chaka [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] into a feral black [[werecat]] called the "Coal Tiger". Coal Tiger\'s bestial abilities were able to turn the tide in A-Next\'s favor. He was offered membership with the team after the battle was won, but he declined, stating that he would be available to help if they needed him.<ref>\'\'A-Next\'\' Vol. 1 #4</ref>\n\nWhen all of the members of A-Next were captured by an evil version of A-Next called the [[Revengers]], Coal Tiger was one of the many heroes who came to free the captured superheroes.

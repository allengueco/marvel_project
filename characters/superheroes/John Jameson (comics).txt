He is the son of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and the grandson of J. Jonah Jameson, Sr.\n\n==Publication history==\nJohn Jameson debuted in \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' #1 (March 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].<ref name="Manning18">{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 18|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= [\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #1] introduced readers to \'\'The Daily Bugle\'\' publisher and anti-Spider-Man activist J. Jonah Jameson, as Spidey saved his astronaut son, John, from a space mission gone awry.}}</ref> This first story introduces the character as a prominent [[astronaut]].\n\nDuring his lengthy stint on \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' during the 1970s, writer [[Gerry Conway]] had Jameson turned into a [[werewolf]], with the new alias "Man-Wolf". Conway explained: {{quote|I\'d wanted to do something with [John Jameson] for a long time. I felt like he was a character who\'d gotten lost over the years. Also, at this point, it\'s 1973, John Jameson is an astronaut, and [[Apollo 11|we\'ve been to the moon]], so I asked myself, "What would we do with that in Spider-Man\'s world?" And that was how it played out. It also added another layer of tension to Spider-Man\'s relationship with J. Jonah Jameson. As a writer, you always want to find a way to increase the pressure on the main character, to increase the involvement of other characters with that character. Consequently, anything that could make Jonah\'s hatred of Spider-Man more intense and at the same time more understandable was a useful device dramatically.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 10|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>}} As the Man-Wolf, Jameson was the lead feature in \'\'[[Creatures on the Loose]]\'\' #30 (July 1974) to #37 (September 1975).<ref>Manning "1970s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 75: "Man-Wolf was awarded his own regular spotlight in the ongoing title \'\'Creatures on the Loose\'\'...Man-Wolf\'s adventures became the focus of this title until its conclusion with issue #37."</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nJohn Jonah Jameson III was born in [[New York City]]. He is the son of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], the irascible, gruff publisher of the \'\'[[Daily Bugle]]\'\'. Jonah is immensely proud of his son, whom he sees as a true hero. Initially an astronaut, he was first seen being saved by [[Spider-Man]] when his craft malfunctioned on re-entry,<ref name="Manning18" /> something that did nothing to endear the wall-crawler to his father, who resents Spider-Man\'s form of heroism.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #1 (March 1963)</ref>\n\nOn a later mission, Jameson was infected with spores that gave him super-strength, but strained his body and mind. He was forced to wear a strength-restraining "Jupiter suit" and battled Spider-Man at his father\'s urging before recovering and calling himself \'\'\'Colonel Jupiter\'\'\'. His father convinced him to go after Spider-Man, who had been seen apparently robbing a bank. The web-slinger outsmarted him, and Jonah soon learned that Spider-Man was saving the bank from a bomb. However, John didn\'t care about the misunderstanding; he was really out for revenge.

It was revealed that the ruby was created by the dying Stargod to pass on his powers. While on Earth Jameson could only partially transform, resulting in his berserk behavior. While in the Other Realm he could fully transform, resulting in retention of his human consciousness while in lupine form. He took up the mantle of \'\'\'Stargod\'\'\', and acted as champion of the Other Realm, and gained new powers such as [[telepathy]] and energy manipulation.

He spent some time as Ravencroft Head of Security and briefly dated its director Dr. Ashley Kafka. Both John and Ashley were fired by a director angry about the escape of the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and his subsequent wounding by [[Kraven the Hunter]] II. Via hypnotherapy, Kafka helped discover that [[Jack O\'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O\'Lantern]] had caused him to attack his hospitalized father. This therapy also briefly unleashed John\'s Man-Wolf aspect before Ashley was able to help John suppress his changes once more.\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\'\' storyline, John helped Captain America while the latter was in hiding. He was assisting She-Hulk in locating and signing up unregistered superheroes. John has also been registered as the Man-Wolf under the [[Registration acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} During this time, the villain [[Stegron]] temporarily transformed him into the Man-Wolf again, as a side-effect of his latest mad scheme, to devolve the entire population of New York City.

Jameson did not retain his personality or intelligence while in Man-Wolf form. He was not a traditional werewolf and was invulnerable to silver.\n\n===As Stargod=== \nWhile in the Other Realm, Jameson possessed both his human intellect and the Man-Wolf\'s body, as well as vast superhuman strength, a high degree of durability, and cosmic and telepathic powers, the full extent of which is yet unrevealed.

However, when he attempts to save an astronaut from his crashing capsule (the same situation from which he was saved by Spider-Man in [[Earth-616|mainstream continuity]]), his rocket pack runs out of fuel, but Jameson heroically sacrifices his life by using his own body to cushion the capsule\'s impact.

John Jameson ended up in the hospital following the crash-landing. When J. Jonah Jameson visits John in the hospital, John Jameson mentions about Spider-Man fighting "[[Rhino (comics)|a guy in a rhino suit]]" which proved that Rhino was the one who robbed the shuttle. Shocker later abducted John Jameson from the hospital which draws Spider-Man and J. Jonah Jameson to an abandoned church. While Spider-Man fought Shocker, J. Jonah Jameson got his son away from the church. While still in a wheelchair following his abduction, John Jameson visited the Daily Bugle where he was welcomed by its staff.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ManWolfSpiderManUnlimited.jpg|thumb|right|Man-Wolf battling Spider-Man in \'\'Spider-Man Unlimited\'\'.]] -->\n* The character appeared in \'\'[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]\'\', with John Jameson voiced by [[John Payne (voice actor)|John Payne]] while Man-Wolf\'s vocal effects are provided by [[Scott McNeil]].{{cn|date=February 2018}} While traveling into space, John Jameson crashed on [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] thanks to [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].

Jonah Jameson]] planned on writing an article on how John saved New York City by finding the [[Green Goblin]]\'s planted bomb, John warned him it would lead to an investigation that would pull him from a coming space mission so Jameson reluctantly attributed John\'s actions to Spider-Man. Later on, his spaceship malfunctions after being hit by an asteroid and nearly crashes (similar to \'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #1) but John is able to safely land his ship, which contains the alien symbiote. Jonah\'s anger that other newspapers which had [[Spider-Man]]\'s battle with Green Goblin on the front page sold more than the Daily Bugle, with John\'s survival as the front-page story, caused Jonah to intensify his hatred for Spider-Man and discredit him even more. In the episode "Growing Pains", John is revealed to have been exposed to alien spores, due to contact with the symbiote, that have been making him bigger, heavier and stronger, causing [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] to design a special suit for him. At the time when [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] was framing Spider-Man, Jonah had his son become the superhero \'Colonel Jupiter\'. Venom attacked him, framing Spider-Man and causing the spores\' effects on him to increase, eventually leading Jameson to fight Spider-Man. After a brutal fight, Spider-Man discovered that electricity could destroy the spores. Upon being exposed to 2,000,000 volts of electricity, John returned to being physically normal. He later ended up in Ravencroft still craving the power from the spores.\n* John Jameson/Man-Wolf appears in the \'\'[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]\'\' episode "The Man-Wolf", voiced by [[Nolan North]].<ref name="btva"/> Spider-Man, his team (consisting of [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]]), and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] answer a distress signal coming from J. Jonah Jameson to look for his son on the moon that was supervising the construction of a \'\'Daily Bugle\'\' communications station. Onsite however, the construction crew found the remains of an advanced civilization harboring a number of strange jewels. One of these jewels has embedded itself in John\'s chest and triggered his transformation into the feral Man-Wolf (with the trappings and the sword used by Stargod). Spider-Man manages to shatter the jewel, but the sudden reversion causes John to retain some wolfish features. John Jameson is kept in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody for treatment while J. Jonah Jameson blames Spider-Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. for his son\'s condition. Nick Fury told J. Jonah Jameson that his son was saved because of Spider-Man and to put that in his moustache and "chew on it."\n* John Jameson/Man-Wolf appears in \'\'[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]\'\', voiced by [[Josh Keaton]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Halloween Moon|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=11|airdate=October 7, 2017}}</ref> In the episode "Osborn Academy," John Jameson is among the people that audition for a spot in Osborn Academy where he shows his space program knowledge. In the episode "Halloween Moon," John Jameson and Harry Osborn worked on an experiment that involved a lunar crystal that fed off gamma radiation which turned John Jameson into Man-Wolf whose scratch turned those who were struck by Man-Wolf\'s claws into werewolves. It took Spider-Man, Hulk, Gwen Stacy, and Harry Osborn to undo the effects of the Man-Wolf transformations and cure the infected. While Norman Osborn was displeased that he got Harry involved upon being given the lunar crystal, John Jameson stated the Man-Wolf form had a different personality as Norman Osborn plans to find a way to fix the lunar crystal\'s effects.\n\n===Film===\n* John Jameson appeared in \'\'[[Spider-Man 2]]\'\', portrayed by [[Daniel Gillies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/848044/spider-man-turns-15-60-actors-you-forgot-appeared-in-marvel-movies|title=Spider-Man Turns 15: 60 Actors You Forgot Appeared in Marvel Movies|website=E!

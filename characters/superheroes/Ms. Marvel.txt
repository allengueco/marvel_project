The character was originally conceived as a female counterpart to [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. Like Captain Marvel, most of the bearers of the Ms. Marvel title gain their powers through [[Kree]] technology or genetics. Marvel has published four ongoing comic series titled \'\'Ms. Marvel\'\', with the first two starring \'\'\'[[Carol Danvers]]\'\'\', and the third and fourth starring \'\'\'[[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Kamala Khan]]\'\'\'.\n\n== Carol Danvers ==\n{{main|Carol Danvers}}\nCarol Danvers, the first character to use the moniker Ms. Marvel, first appeared in \'\'Marvel Super-Heroes\'\' #13 (March 1968) by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Gene Colan]] as a non-superpowered officer in the [[United States Air Force]]. After being caught in an explosion with the [[Kree]] superhero [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]] in \'\'Captain Marvel\'\' #18 (November 1969), Danvers resurfaces in \'\'Ms. Marvel\'\' #1 (January 1977) with super powers as result of the explosion which caused her DNA to merge with Captain Marvel\'s. As Ms. Marvel, Danvers becomes a mainstay of the superhero team [[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], beginning in \'\'[[The Avengers (comic)|The Avengers]]\'\' #171 (May 1978). Danvers goes on to use the codenames \'\'\'Binary\'\'\'<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #164 (December 1982)</ref> and \'\'\'Warbird\'\'\'.<ref>Avengers vol. 3 #4 (May 1998)</ref> In July 2012, Danvers assumes the mantle \'\'\'Captain Marvel\'\'\' in honor of its dead, original holder, Mar-Vell, after [[Captain America]] tells her that Mar-Vell would want her to have it.<ref name=Beard120317>{{cite web |last=Beard |first=Jim |date=17 March 2012 |title=WonderCon 2012: Captain Marvel |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/18290/wondercon_2012_captain_marvel |website=marvel.com |publisher=Marvel |accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Sharon Ventura ==\n{{main|Sharon Ventura}}\nSharon Ventura, the second character to use the pseudonym Ms. Marvel, first appeared in \'\'[[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]\'\' #27 (September 1985), by [[Mike Carlin]] and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]], as a [[stunt performer]] with the [[Thunderiders]], where she met The Thing. In \'\'The Thing\'\' #35 (May 1986), Ventura volunteered for [[Power Broker]]\'s experiment to receive superpowers in order to join the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]] with The Thing, taking the name Ms. Marvel. Ventura later joins the [[Fantastic Four]] herself in \'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #307 (October 1987) and, after being hit by cosmic rays in \'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #310 (January 1988), Ventura\'s body mutates into a similar appearance to that of The Thing and receives the nickname \'\'\'She-Thing\'\'\'.\n\n== Karla Sofen ==\n{{main|Moonstone (comics)}}\n[[Moonstone (comics)|Dr. Karla Sofen]], the supervillain known as \'\'\'Moonstone\'\'\', first appeared as the [[gun moll]] of [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]], in \'\'[[Captain America]]\'\' #192 (December 1975) by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Frank Robbins]]. In \'\'[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]\'\' #228 (October 1978), Sofen becomes the psychiatrist of the villain Moonstone, also known as [[Nefarius|Lloyd Bloch]]. Sofen tricks Bloch into giving her the meteorite that empowers him, and she adopts both the name and abilities of Moonstone. During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Sofen joins [[Norman Osborn]]\'s group of Avengers, known as the [[Dark Avengers]], as the doppelganger of the previous Ms. Marvel, Carol Danvers.<ref>\'\'[[Dark Avengers]]\'\' #1 (January 2009)</ref> Sofen becomes the title character of the \'\'Ms. Marvel\'\' series beginning in issue #38 (June 2009) until Danvers takes the title back in issue #47 (January 2010).\n\n== Kamala Khan ==\n{{main|Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)}}\nKamala Khan, created by [[Sana Amanat]], [[G. Willow Wilson]], and [[Adrian Alphona]], is the fourth character to take the name Ms. Marvel. Khan first appeared in \'\'Captain Marvel\'\' #17 (November 2013) and is a 16-year-old [[Pakistani-American]] from [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], who idolizes Carol Danvers. Khan was given her own \'\'Ms. Marvel\'\' series, which premiered in February 2014, becoming Marvel Comics\' first [[Muslim]] character to headline her own comic book.<ref>Robinson, Wills (6 November 2013).

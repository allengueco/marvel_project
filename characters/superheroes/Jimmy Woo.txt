Created by [[Entertaining Comics|EC Comics]] writer [[Al Feldstein]] and artist [[Joe Maneely]], the [[Chinese-American]] character first appeared in \'\'[[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]]\'\' #1 (October 1956) from [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s predecessor of Marvel. Woo has since appeared occasionally in a variety of Marvel publications.\n\n==Publication history==\nJimmy Woo was the hero of the [[spy fiction|espionage]] series \'\'[[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]]\'\', named for his [[antagonist]], a "[[yellow peril]]" [[Communist]] [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]].{{clarify|reason="communist mandarin"? Is this a joke?|Obviously we\'re talking about fiction, but we shouldn\'t do so matter-of-factly as though such material isn\'t nonsense.|date=January 2018}} While the short-lived series named after that villain ran only four issues (October 1956 - April 1957), it featured art by Maneely, [[Jack Kirby]], and [[John Severin]].\n\nKirby took over as writer-artist with issue #2 \xe2\x80\x94 [[inker|inking]] his own [[penciller|pencil art]] there and in the following issue, representing two of the very rare occasions on which he did so. On the final issue, the inking was done by [[Western fiction|Western]]- and [[war-comics]] veteran Severin. Also, other artists drew the covers: Severin on #2 and #4, [[Bill Everett]] on #3.\n\nWell regarded{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} for its relatively mature storyline and in particular for Maneely\'s exquisitely atmospheric art,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} the book nevertheless failed to find an audience. Woo and other characters from the series were brought into the Marvel universe a decade later, beginning with the "[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]" story in \'\'[[Strange Tales]]\'\' #160 (Sept. 1967). Woo joins that espionage agency in \'\'[[Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (1968 series)|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]\'\' #2 (July 1968).\n\nWoo went on to be featured in the 1977-1979 Marvel series \'\'[[Godzilla (comics)|Godzilla]]\'\' and the 2006-07 Marvel series \'\'[[Agents of Atlas]]\'\'. Before the cancellation of the 1990s [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] Marvel imprint [[Razorline]], as produced but unpublished titles of its various series were preparing to blend the Razorline into primary Marvel continuity, Woo as well as [[Nick Fury]] and other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents guest-starred in \'\'Wraitheart\'\' #5.<!--sources for previous sentence include:\nhttp://www.clivebarker.dial.pipex.com/newothers.html\nhttp://www.glasshousegraphics.com/creators/pencilers/HectorGomez/index.htm\nhttp://www.hoboes.com/pub/Comics/About%20Comics/Comics%20News/Fit%20to%20Print/1995/Fit%20to%20Print%20526\nhttp://66.218.69.11/search/cache?p=wraitheart&sm=Yahoo%21+Search&toggle=1&ei=UTF-8&u=www.glasshousegraphics.com/creators/pencilers/HectorGomez/&w=wraitheart&d=4FB63C95B2&icp=1&.intl=us,\n     with Wraitheart art at\nhttp://www.comicartfans.com/GalleryRoom.asp?GSub=526\n     and\nhttp://www.comicartfans.com/GalleryPiece.asp?Page=1&Order=Date&Piece=36203&GSub=2066&GCat=0&UCat=0-->\nWoo starred as the leader of a team of S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives code-named [[Agents of Atlas]], in the 2006-2007 series of that name.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n[[Image:JimmyWoo ST.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jimmy Woo, from \'\'[[Strange Tales]]\'\' #166 (March 1968). Art by [[Jim Steranko]] & [[Joe Sinnott]].]]\nJames Woo is an [[Asian-American]] [[FBI]] agent assigned primarily to investigate and apprehend the [[China|Chinese]]-national mandarin known as the Yellow Claw, a [[Fu Manchu]] [[manqu\xc3\xa9]] (author [[Sax Rohmer]] had a Fu Manchu novel titled \'\'[[The Yellow Claw]]\'\'). The Yellow Claw, who attempts world domination, claimed in 2000s comics that his American rubric is a mistransliteration of the Chinese characters for "Golden Claw".<ref>\'\'Agents of Atlas\'\' #4 (Jan. 2007)</ref> Complicating matters, the Claw\'s grandniece, Suwan, was in love with Woo in the 1950s series.\n\nIn [[retcon]] stories, Woo is the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent assigned in 1958 to oversee the 1950s superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], a short-lived predecessor of the later, more established team of that name.<ref>\'\'[[What If (comics)|What If]]\'\' Vol. 1, #9 (June 1978)</ref><ref>the 2000s miniseries \'\'[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]\'\'.</ref>\n\nAs a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Woo went on to join its "[[Godzilla Squad]]" to hunt down the giant monster [[Godzilla]] (the character from the long-running series of films from the [[Japan]]ese [[movie studio]] [[Toho]]). This unit, led by [[Dum Dum Dugan]], employed such weapons as a [[Mecha|giant robot]] called [[Red Ronin]] (for which Woo was shortlisted as a pilot candidate), and was headquartered in a smaller version of the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]], known as the Behemoth.<ref>\'\'Godzilla\'\' #1-24</ref>\n\nWoo was temporarily replaced by a [[Life Model Decoy]] (a form of [[Android (robot)|artificial human]] utilized by S.H.I.E.L.D.) of the self-aware, renegade "Deltan" class,<ref>\'\'Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.\'\' #1 (June 1988)</ref> and went through five such bodies before dying with other repentant LMDs.<ref>\'\'Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.\'\' #6 (Nov. 1988)</ref> Woo reemerged from stasis, along with other high-ranking officers that had been taken and replaced.<ref>\'\'Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD\'\' Vol.2 #45</ref>\n\nIn 2006-2007 stories, Woo attempted a secret raid of a group identified as [[Agents of Atlas|The Atlas Foundation]]. Going [[AWOL]] and taking several other willing agents with him, he infiltrated an Atlas Foundation location, resulting in all the recruits being killed. Woo was critically burned and lost higher brain function. The former 1950s Avenger [[Gorilla-Man]], by now also a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, gave the organization a classified record of the 1950s team, of which S.H.I.E.L.D. had no prior knowledge. Gorilla-Man rescues Woo with the aid of fellow 1950s teammates [[M-11 (comics)|M-11]] and [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Marvel Boy]], who restores Woo to his 1958 self.<ref>\'\'Agents of Atlas\'\' vol. 1 #1</ref>\n\nAlong with his teammates he follows the Atlas Foundation all over the world, unlocking secrets about his teammates former lives, restoring [[Namora]] to life,<ref>\'\'Agents of Atlas\'\' vol. 1 #4</ref> and eventually confronting Yellow Claw, who reveals that the whole ordeal was only a test. As Woo passed it flawlessly, he commits [[suicide]], ending his long life and granting to Jimmy Woo his role as Head of the Atlas Foundation, and Suwan\'s hand.<ref>\'\'Agents of Atlas\'\' vol. 1 #6</ref> Woo later surfaces in New York, where he and [[Spider-Man]] shut down a rebellious cell of the Atlas Foundation.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]\'\' storyline, it is shown that Jimmy is now the head of the Pan-Asian School For The Unusually Gifted, a [[Mumbai]]-based school for Asian teenagers with superhuman abilities.

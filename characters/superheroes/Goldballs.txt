After manifesting his abilities, the [[bouncing ball]]s emanating from his body frighten onlookers, and he is taken into custody by the San Diego Police Department. However, [[Cyclops]] and his group of [[X-Men]] arrive just in time to rescue him. A squad of different-sized [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] attack the new mutant and Cyclops\'s team, who managed to destroy the Sentinels. Fabio is then invited to join the X-Men when they departed San Diego. Although Fabio is reluctant, he decides to follow them. Fabio then joins the X-Men during their visit to Eva Bell\'s home and the encounter with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], before being dragged into limbo during [[Dormammu]]\'s attempt to kill them. In the aftermath, Fabio demands to be taken home, where his family questions his disappearance and is befuddled at his claims of being a mutant.{{issue|date=April 2016}}\n\nWhen [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Alison Blaire (Dazzler)]] arrives and questions him about Cyclops\'s location, Fabio loses control of his powers. He is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody but is again rescued by Cyclops\' team and rejoins them. He later assists in the battle against the Blockbuster Sentinel by concentrating the emission of his gold balls to topple them. He then assumes the mutant nickname "Goldballs".{{issue|date=April 2016}}\n\nAfter many adventures under the guidance of [[Illyana Rasputin]] and [[Shadowcat]], Goldballs and his teammates express uncertainty about continuing as students anymore.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #18 (October 2014).

Goldballs can summon an infinite number of them, which are able to bounce, emitting a "poink" sound when they hit something. If he concentrates, he can project them in a straight line or direct them to a specific area. Normally the balls can be reabsorbed into his body, though when Goldballs is calm, he can cause them to disappear.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bendis, Brian Michael|url=http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Uncanny_X-Men_Vol_3_1|title=The Uncanny X-Men Vol.3 #1: The New Revolution|date=February 13, 2013|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite comic|title=Uncanny X-Men|volume=3|issue=1\xe2\x80\x9312, 16\xe2\x80\x9332|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=Various dates}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]'

The Ani-Mator subjected his creations to a number of cruel and deadly experiments, but Bird-Brain escapes the Ani-Mator\'s island and befriends the [[New Mutants]]. They try to acclimate him to regular society, which fails miserably time and again, mainly because Bird-Brain would eat all the food he saw.<ref name="movie incident">\'\'New Mutants\'\' #57</ref> For the most part, Bird-Brain is unable to communicate with the New Mutants, despite the language powers of the New Mutant [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], because of how simplistic Bird-Brain\'s language is.<ref name="movie incident"/> In his first conversation with Cypher, Bird-Brain explains that he has been trained with food by starving him and using food as a reward.<ref name="movie incident"/>\n\nBird-Brain develops relatively close relationships with Cypher (who is fascinated by Bird-Brain\'s language) and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] for her changeling ability, through which he sees her as a kindred spirit, and her general kindness to him.<ref name="language learning">\'\'New Mutants\'\' #58</ref> Feeling he had abandoned the other mutated creatures on the island, Bird-Brain eventually returns with the New Mutants to free them.<ref name="language learning"/> The Ani-Mator, attempting to shoot Wolfsbane, instead kills Cypher, and [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]] exiles the Ani-Mator to the dimension of [[Otherplace|Limbo]] in retaliation.<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' #60</ref> Once freed from the Ani-Mator\'s tyranny, Bird-Brain decides to remain on the island with the other Ani-Mates.<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' #61</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://en.marveldatabase.com/Bird-Brain_%28Earth-616%29 Bird-Brain] at the Marvel Database Project\n*[http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/bird-brain Bird-Brain] at UncannyXmen.net\n\n{{New Mutants}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Louise Simonson]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1987]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]'

Disillusioned at the law\'s inability to protect society from crime, he resigned from the force and became a vigilante named \'Americop\'.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' (1st series) #428</ref>\n\nHe travels across America and uses a police scanner to track down criminals. He is not above executing the criminals he thinks deserve said fate. He sometimes takes money from the drug-trafficking criminals he battles, keeping half and donating the rest to drug rehabilitation programs. Americop finds himself in conflict with [[Captain America]] while trying to bring down a child exploitation ring; Captain America is appalled by his brutality.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' (1st series) #429</ref>\n\nAmericop\'s investigation led him to the [[New Orleans]] mansion of indestructible munitions magnate [[Damon Dran]]. Although initially subdued by a gas grenade attack and imprisoned alongside Captain America, he manages to break free. During the fight, he kills several of Dran\'s mercenaries. During the resulting fight, he shoots down Dran\'s helicopter. Americop believes Dran died during the crash when the criminal in fact survived.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' (1st series) #430</ref>\n\nAfter the super-hero \'\'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\'\', Americop is a target on the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]\' Most Wanted list. [[Norman Osborn]] sends [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]] and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] to battle Americop, with the secret hope the vigilante will kill the two (as both haven\'t been worth the trouble). Instead, the two crash Americop\'s truck and Bullseye causes Penance\'s stored-up energy to be unleashed which fries 80 percent of the vigilante\'s synaptic nerve endings.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts: Desperate Measures\'\'</ref>\n\nHe later died (presumably from his injuries) and had his uniform and code name copied by a [[Private security company|private security force]] called the Americops run by Keane Industries.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Daniel Acu\xc3\xb1a|inker = Daniel Acu\xc3\xb1a|colorist = Daniel Acu\xc3\xb1a|letterer = VC\'s Joe Caramagna|editor = Tom Brevoort|title = Captain America: Sam Wilson|volume = 1|issue = #12|date = 17 August 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n*A formidable martial artist and strategist, Americop carries [[.45 caliber pistol]]s, a baton and a fixed blade tactical [[knife]]  \n*He wears bulletproof [[Kevlar]] body armor, a ballistic facemask and a customized cap which doubles as a throwing weapon. His costume includes a device that absorbs ambient electrical energy and uses it to increase his strength to low-superhuman levels.<ref>\'\'All New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe HC\'\' #1</ref> \n*His [[pickup truck]] has a roof-mounted lightbar, police [[Siren (noisemaker)|siren]], [[public address system]] and [[bulletproof]] armor and windows.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvelwiki|Americop|Americop}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/americop.htm|Americop}}\n\n{{Captain America}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Gruenwald]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1994]]\n[[Category:Fictional American police officers]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Texas]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:United States-themed superheroes]]'

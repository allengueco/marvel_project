Even after many of the Guard chose to side with Sam\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa0r, Oracle (a.k.a. Sybil) remained steadfast in her loyalty to then-Empress [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]]. On a mission to find Lilandra, Oracle joined the other Imperial Guardsmen, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Kitty Pryde]] in battling Lord Sam\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa0r\'s renegade Imperial Guardsmen.

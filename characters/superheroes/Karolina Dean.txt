The character first appeared in the series \'\'[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]\'\'. Like every member of the original Runaways, she is the daughter of evil super-powered criminals; while searching through her parents\' home, Karolina inadvertently discovers that her parents were [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#M|Majesdanian]] invaders. Majesdanians are an [[Fictional extraterrestrials|alien]] race that absorbs solar energy and re-radiates it in the form of the colors of the rainbow. She is often called "Kar" or "K" for short, and is known for her free spirit and kind nature.\n\nKarolina is the group\'s only lesbian character. She is the only extraterrestrial in the group, except for a period of time when her [[Skrull]] fianc\xc3\xa9e, [[Xavin]], becomes part of the team.<ref name="comicvine">[http://www.comicvine.com/karolina-dean/29-1943/ Karolina Dean]</ref> \'\'Runaways\'\' creator Brian K. Vaughan played a significant role in the character\'s subsequent development as well as artist/writer Adrian Alphona, both of whom spent most of the first volume of the series hinting that Karolina was romantically attracted to fellow member [[Nico Minoru]]. By \'\'Runaways\'\'\'s fourth relaunch, Karolina\'s storyline picks up with her relationship with [[Julie Power|Lightspeed]] of [[Power Pack]] referenced in \'\'[[Avengers Academy]]\'\'.\n\nKarolina Dean is portrayed by [[Virginia Gardner]] in the [[Hulu]] television series \'\'[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]\'\' which is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].\n\n==Publication history==\nKarolina Dean was created by author [[Brian K. Vaughan]] & artist Adrian Alphona and debuted in \'\'Runaways\'\' #1.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===The Pride===\nKarolina is the daughter of renowned [[Hollywood]] actors Frank and Leslie Dean and is the only older Runaway who didn\'t witness [[Pride (comics)|their parents]] murder an innocent girl as a sacrifice.  Karolina denies the entire situation primarily, but finally believes the group soon after discovering she is an alien.<ref name="Vol1#1">\'\'Runaways\'\': Volume 1, #1</ref> The kids decide to go for a massive ransack, and leave home; before leaving for good, they decide to put their parents to justice by collecting certain evidence from their homes. When arriving at the Dean mansion, they find Karolina\'s parent\'s last will and testament; Karolina is given a piece of paper with the circular "[[no symbol]]" covering [[Caduceus|the Caduceus]]. Alex convinces her to remove her [[medic alert bracelet]] because it is emblazoned with the symbol. Karolina angrily concedes, thinking that she only wears the bracelet because she\'s allergic to penicillin, and her skin immediately glows with a fluid, rainbow-like light.<ref name="Vol1#3">\'\'Runaways\'\': Volume 1, #3</ref> Remembering something they heard from the Pride\'s sacrifice, the group assumes Karolina is an alien and the bracelet is an anchor to hide her powers; Leslie Dean later confirms these theories for Karolina.<ref name="Vol1#6">\'\'Runaways\'\': Volume 1, #6</ref> After escaping their parents, Karolina takes the name Lucy in the Sky, a reference to the song "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]".<ref name="Vol1#6"/>\n\n===Personality===\nEarly in the series, Karolina constantly struggled with her alien heritage, feeling that she is a "freak" amongst the group, the only one who needs to actively hide her true form.<ref name="Vol1#3"/> Another insecurity was of her speculated homosexuality. Her insecurities even prompt Karolina to offer her life to the [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] [[Topher (comics)|Topher]], as Karolina expresses little desire to live.<ref name="Vol1#12">\'\'Runaways\'\': Volume 1, #12</ref> After her first near-death experience at the hands of [[Alex Wilder]], Karolina overcomes her [[death drive|death wish]] and helps the Runaways escape the rampaging [[Gibborim (comics)|Gibborim]] as the Pride fight their former benefactors.<ref name="Vol1#18">\'\'Runaways\'\': Volume 1, #17</ref> After the Pride\'s defeat, Karolina is sent to live with foster parents, but she organizes a secret reunion for the Runaways, after which they run away again, this time to the Pride\'s old lair beneath the [[La Brea Tar Pits]].<ref name="Vol1#18"/> Karolina is portrayed as having a wide, free spirit, notably when she discovers she can fly. But she is also shown as being quite sensitive, often crying at her pain and misfortune, as well as the pain and misfortune of others.\n\n===As a fugitive===\n[[Image:Karolina\'s lives.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Karolina\'s twisted dream.]]\nIn the early issues of \'\'Runaways\'\', volume 2, Karolina fights under the command of de facto leader Nico. Karolina expresses more comfort with being an extraterrestrial<ref name="Vol2#1">\'\'Runaways\'\': Volume 2, #1</ref> and makes strong hints at being a lesbian, especially as she stops to compliment [[Julie Power]] on her beauty during a battle with [[Loners (comics)|Excelsior]] over the custody of [[Victor Mancha]]<ref>\'\'Runaways\'\' vol. 2 #3</ref> and later even agrees to go on a date with her following a joint [[Avengers Academy]]/Runaways mission<ref>Avengers Academy #28</ref> (and would eventually become romantically involved).<ref>Avengers Academy #39</ref> Soon after Victor joins the team, Karolina "comes out" to Nico with an attempted kiss, which Nico rejects outright.<ref name="Vol2#7">\'\'Runaways\'\': Volume 2, #7</ref> Karolina\'s "outcast" insecurities resurface when her [[Skrull]] fianc\xc3\xa9e [[Xavin]] comes to Earth in search for her.

Much later, Karolina attempted to kiss Nico, but was rejected. Karolina then came out to Nico as a [[lesbian]], admitting her feelings for Nico.<ref name="Vol2#7"/> After deciding to leave Earth to marry Xavin, Karolina left her medical alert bracelet with Nico as a token of remembrance. When Karolina later returned to Earth, she accidentally confessed to Xavin (who had taken on the form of Nico) that she was still in love with Nico. Despite this, Karolina remained staunch in her devotion to Xavin, and thus her feelings for and attraction to Nico occasionally put a strain on their friendship.<ref name="Vol2#30"/>\n\nWhen the Runaways re-banded later as a group two years later, Nico made romantic overtures towards Karolina, ultimately attempting to kiss her. However, Karolina rejected Nico out loyalty to Julie and dismissed it as Nico\'s habit of seeking comfort in times of stress.<ref name="v1#5">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Rainbow Rowell]] | Penciller =  [[Kris Anka]] | Inker =  | Story = Find Your Way Home | Title = Runaways (2017) | Volume = 1 | Issue = 5 | Date = March 2018 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Following Julie and Karolina\'s break-up, Karolina invited Nico to attend her parents\xe2\x80\x99 legitimate foundation\xe2\x80\x99s a charity ball with her.

Karolina initially rejected Xavin; Xavin attempted to persuade her, explaining that the marriage would be part of a peace treaty. Karolina still refused, stating that it would be a "lie" for her to marry a man. Xavin then revealed that Skrulls had the ability to shapeshift into different genders, prompting Karolina to decide to accept the marriage proposal.<ref name="Vol2#8"/> However, they were later unable to get married when war broke out again between the Skrulls and Majesdanians. They escaped to Earth and re-joined the Runaways.<ref name="v2#17">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian K. Vaughan]] | Penciller =  [[Adrian Alphona]] | Inker = | Story = Parental Guidance | Title = Runaways | Volume = 2 | Issue = 17 | Date = June 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Throughout their relationship, Karolina apparently fully accepted Xavin\'s continued changing between male and female appearances. However, she secretly expressed confusion and doubts over Xavin\'s true gender. However, during an argument, Xavin subconsciously reverted to female human form, which pleased Karolina.<ref name="Vol2#30"/> Their relationship ended when Xavin left Earth with a remaining group of Majesdanians, sacrificing themselves for Karolina.<ref name="runv3#6">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Terry Moore (cartoonist)|Terry Moore]] | Penciller =  [[Humberto Ramos]] | Inker =  | Story = Dead Wrong | Title = Runaways | Volume = 3 | Issue = 6 | Date = January 2009 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\n\n===Julie Power===\nKarolina flirted with and later began dating [[Julie Power]], after a trip to Avengers Academy; this resulted in a two year long relationship. Julie attempted to convince Karolina to move to New York so they could be together full-time, though Karolina was resistant to this.<ref name="v2#7">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Rainbow Rowell]] | Penciller =  [[Kris Anka]] | Inker =  | Story = Best Friends Forever | Title = Runaways (2017) | Volume = 2 | Issue = 7 | Date = May 2018 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> After visiting Karolina in Los Angeles, Julie broke up with her, believing that she and Karolina were too incompatible and that Karolina\'s first priority would always be to the Runaways.<ref name="v2#8">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Rainbow Rowell]] | Penciller =  [[Kris Anka]] | Inker =  | Story = Best Friends Forever | Title = Runaways (2017) | Volume = 2 | Issue = 8 | Date = June 2018 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLike all Majesdanians, Karolina\'s natural form is luminous, iridescent, and visually fluid, often depicted with waves of rainbow-like light floating off her body (Chase described her as "a burning painting") though body structure is essentially humanoid.<ref name="Vol1#3"/> Originally, Karolina required a custom made [[medic alert bracelet]] constructed of an unspecified alien metal to revert to humanoid form. However, after spending many months on Majesdane, Karolina learned to control the change and can make it at will.<ref name="Vol2#16"/> In her Majesdanian form, Karolina is able to manipulate solar energy absorbed by her body to generate large concussive blasts, fine [[laser]]-like beams and force fields capable of stopping cave-ins, gunfire and explosions. Like her parents, Karolina learned the ability to bind people, binding a New Pride in a colorful sphere. Karolina\'s Majesdanian form also grants her the ability to fly. During an encounter with the vampire Topher, it is revealed that Karolina\'s blood also harbors [[solar energy]]-based properties, because drinking her blood caused Topher to combust.\n\nThe drawback to Karolina\'s powers is that they have a finite charge. If she is in her Majesdanian form too long or exerts her powers too much, her glow will start to fade and revert her to human form until she uses the sun\'s rays to recharge. The only time she entirely lost her powers was when the Runaways battled the Gibborim to prevent Chase from sacrificing himself.<ref name="Vol2#23"/> Leslie Dean stated early in the series that Majesdanians\' abilities do not affect one another.<ref name="Vol1#18"/>\n\n==Conceptual changes==\nIn Brian K. Vaughan\'s original pitch for the series, Karolina Dean was originally called Leslie. This name would eventually be given to [[Leslie Dean|the character\'s mother]]. Her parents were originally real estate agents, rather than famous actors.<ref name="hardcover">{{cite book|last=K.

Brian Reber, the first colorist of \'\'Runaways\'\', colored Karolina with many different colors of the [[visible spectrum]] from panel to panel.  [[Christina Strain]], the second colorist for \'\'Runaways\'\', colors Karolina in lighter tones, using primarily blue, yellow, and pink with a glitter-like effect.<ref>Pages</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===House of M===\nKarolina Dean is mentioned as being a "go-to" girl for the [[Wolfpack (Marvel Comics)|Wolfpack]].<ref>\'\'House of M: Avengers\'\' #4</ref>  However, this is a ploy to capture the Wolfpack.  It is mentioned, however, that the Pride rule Southern California.\n\n===Marvel Zombies Halloween===\nA zombie Karolina Dean is attacking Kitty Pryde and her son Peter in \'\'Marvel Zombies Halloween\'\'.

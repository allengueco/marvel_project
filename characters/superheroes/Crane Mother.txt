In 1933, a meeting took place with all seven lords where she accused [[Iron_Fist_(comics)|Iron Fist]] ([[Orson Randall]]) of sullying tradition because he refused to participate in the Tournament of the Heavenly Cities. In each city, an immortal weapon, such as the Iron Fist, fights for his city in the tournament. The battles in the tournament decide the order of the cities of the heavenly timeline. All council members except [[Yu-Ti|Lord Tuan]], the leader of K\'un-Lun agreed that Randall should pay and face punishment. Randall would be confronted by the [[Immortal Weapons]] and he ended up killing the [[Davos_(comics)|Davos]] Immortal Weapon of Ku\'n-Zi. Randall would elude capture and Crane Mother had a personal vendetta against him ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/02/09/iron-fist-is-madame-gao-the-crane-mother-/|title=Iron Fist: Is Madame Gao the Crane Mother?|author=Jenna Anderson|date=2017-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-the-order-of-the-crane-mother-iron-fist-connects-dannys-past-to-a-powerful-figure-44790|title=What Is The Order Of The Crane Mother? \'Iron Fist\' Connects Danny\'s Past To A Powerful Figure|author=Jack O\'Keefe|date=2017-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Immortal Iron Fist Vol 1 #4|author=[[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Matt Fraction]]|date=2007-05-01|ASIN=B0028J4VXI|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]| location =[[New York City|New York]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Immortal Iron Fist Vol 1 #8|author=[[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Matt Fraction]]|date=2007-10-01|ASIN=B0014MYV26|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]| location =[[New York City|New York]]}}</ref>\n\n==In other media==\nAlthough the Crane Mother hasn\'t appeared in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] series \'\'[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]\'\', there is a K\'un-L\'un organization called the Order of the Crane Mother that appears in a flashback in the episode "The City\'s Not for Burning."<ref>{{cite episode|title=The City\'s Not for Burning|series=Marvel\'s Iron Fist|credits=Talalay, Rachel (director); Jon Worley (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=September 7, 2018|season=2|number=2}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Crane_Mother_(Earth-616) Crane Mother] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Iron Fist}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Ed Brubaker]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Matt Fraction]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2007]]'

He protects the innocent, captures robbers, and even fights such [[World War II]] menaces as Super Nazi, a pig with a [[Hitler]] mustache. His self-proclaimed "number-one fan" and unasked-for publicist Wilbur Woodpecker occasionally accompanies Super Rabbit, much to his consternation.<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/superrab.htm Super Rabbit] at [[Don Markstein\'s Toonopedia]].

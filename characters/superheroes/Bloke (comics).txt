He was created by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Mike Allred]] in \'\'X-Force\'\' (vol. 1) #117 (2001).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\'\'\'Bloke\'\'\' works as a vigilante in [[San Francisco]], where he is known by the code-name of \'\'\'Curtis Aston\'\'\'. There, he gains control over his skin color, but seemingly prefers pink while in action. He is described, somewhat stereotypically, as being big, pink and having impeccable taste in soft furnishings as well as a penchant for musical theater.  He is recruited for the X-Force team and accepts, hoping to gain "fame\xe2\x80\xa6 money\xe2\x80\xa6 a place in history and the opportunity to put a four-hundred pound guy like me on the cultural map. And chicken would be nice."  According to X-Force intelligence, Bloke kills an average of six people per mission and has done so over two years, mainly from his own side. Part of his career includes being deployed against a [[Balkan]] terrorist group. He is shown pulling off the head of a [[tank]] driver.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' vol. 1 #117 (2001)</ref>\n\nHis first X-Force mission involves a trip to the [[South America]]n nation of Bastrona. Their goal is to gain control of a refugee child named Paco Perez who has the mutant potential to cure many diseases; the mission commander, [[Coach (comics)|Coach]], wants to sell Paco to [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]]. The Greenpeace forces learn of the mission and attack. While outside, Bloke leaps to protect their informant, taking several mortal wounds.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' vol. 1 #118 (2001)</ref>\n\nBloke\'s body is burned by his teammates; the child Paco Perez is secretly sent to live with the father of [[Saint Anna (comics)|Saint Anna]], Bloke\'s teammate, who also dies saving Perez.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBloke\'s mutant powers give him superhuman strength, endurance, reflexes, and durability, as well as the ability to blend in with his surroundings by changing the color of his skin, like a [[camouflage]] similar to a [[chameleon]]\'s. However, when using this camouflage, his strength is temporarily reduced to that of a normal human.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060905050631/http://www.gayleague.com/gay/characters/display.php?id=20 Gay League Profile]\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional gay males]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:LGBT superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Peter Milligan]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike Allred]]'

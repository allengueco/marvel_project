The character was created by [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Christopher Priest]] and [[Dan Fraga]] in \'\'[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]\'\' vol.3, #9.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Vulcan Domuyo===\n\'\'\'Manuel Diego Armand Vicente\'\'\' was born in the United States but raised in his parents\' native (fictional) [[South America]]n country of \'\'\'Vulcan Domuyo\'\'\'. Vulcan Domuyo is reminiscent of pre-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] [[Cuba]] except that Vulcan Domuyo was built around an active volcano.\n\nVicente grew to become a high-ranking officer of \'\'\'Los Cuarenta Ladrones\'\'\' (the LCL), meaning "the Forty Thieves," a dismissive colloquialism for El Ministerio de Asuntos Internacionales Arm\xc3\xb3 Servicio de Vulcan Domuyo\xe2\x80\x94the Vulcan Domuyan [[Secret Police]]. Moreover, due to his dual citizenship, Vicente (who used the alias Danny Vincent) became an agent for U.S. intelligence, writing books for the [[National Security Agency]]. Danny regularly did black bag operations for the LCL and the Americans with the code-name Junta.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Wakanda===\nIn a recent operation, Danny accepted money from a [[CIA]] front, by way of a Russian mobster, to fund an operation to de-stabilize the African nation of Ghudaza. Supposedly, this would be nearly impossible to trace back to the American intelligence community, who hoped to ultimately de-stabilize Ghudaza\'s neighboring nation, [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]]. Unfortunately, Danny\'s operation caused Ghudaza to degenerate into civil war and resultant ethnic genocide, sending a flood of refugees into Wakanda.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nLater, the LCL, the Russian mob, and the rogue CIA agents Danny worked with earlier formed a shadowy transcontinental cooperative called XCON. XCON began replacing highly placed political figures with clone-like duplicates. XCON also began killing key intelligence operatives, causing Danny to flee his former employers of the LCL. As insurance for his own safety, Danny took with him the [[President of the United States]], as XCON had replaced him with a duplicate some weeks before. Danny sought help from operatives of the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], ultimately teaming with the Panther\'s ally, [[Queen Divine Justice]]. Danny and Queen finally returned the President safely to the [[White House]] at the same time the Black Panther and his ally [[Iron Man]] managed to topple XCON.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Little Mogadishu===\nDanny was left a pariah, as neither the LCL, his U.S. contacts, nor any espionage agency would talk to him. Danny found his way to his birthplace in [[Queens, New York]], turning to freelance mercenary work.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nWhen we meet Danny in issue #3 of the Crew, he has just moved into Little [[Mogadishu]] and supposedly intends to take over his late father\'s failing dry cleaning business. He is interviewing for store employees when word of the derailment of the "Money Train" comes over the news.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nDanny knows that Grace & Tumbalt, the gang-owned corporation that developed Princeton Walk (and consequently created Little Mogadishu) launders money for the [[CIA]]. Danny reasons Grace & Tumbalt\'s connections are his way back into the spy game. He ingratiates himself with Grace & Tumbalt operative Nigel "Triage" Blacque, who sends Danny out to investigate the Money Train derailment as a test of his abilities.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nDanny makes it to The Money Train, only to find [[Kasper Cole]] (The White Tiger) pinned down by crossfire. He rescues Tiger as a matter of convenience\xe2\x80\x94 more to get him out of the way. He explains his gravity powers by telling Kasper he\'s the son of a super-villain. Kasper knows from Black Panther\xe2\x80\x99s files that Danny is actually the super-spy Junta, but plays along so he can keep an eye on Junta.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nIn fact, the subway was derailed by Jim Rhodes ([[War Machine]]), who had declared war on the 66 Bridge Gang, as they were also responsible for the death of his sister. Rhodes gets the drop on Junta and Kasper Cole, leaving them handcuffed together by the wreck, but he later relents and winds up helping them escape.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nRhodes had actually placed a chemical tracer on the Money Train so as to trace the agents of the 66 Bridges Gang to the top echelons. Rhodes pulls together Danny as well as [[Kasper Cole]] and [[Josiah X]] into an erstwhile team as each of them had reasons of their own to see the end of the 66 Bridges Gang. Junta, for his part, now sees an opportunity to hand Triage over to his superiors in the 66 Bridges of Chicago, earning back his underworld cred. The team managed to bring down scores of crooked cops, [[politician]]s and justice officials, as well as Triage. After a climactic battle, Danny personally turns Triage over to the authorities, despite the fact that this action will sever all his former underworld connections.{{issue|date=April 2013}}<ref>[http://phonogram.us/comics/crew/danny.htm digital-priest.com: The Crew: Junta<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===The Defenders===\nPost [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]], Junta is listed among the superhumans being considered as a potential recruit by the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]].<ref name="civilwarbattledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & [[Ronald Byrd]] | Penciller =  [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story =  | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> He is as-yet unregistered when he is recruited by [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] to serve temporarily with the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>{{Cite comic  | Writer = Joe Casey | Penciller = Jim Muniz | Inker = Cam Smith | Story = The Movement You Need| Title = The Last Defenders  | Volume = 1 | Issue = 3 | Date = July 2008 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]  | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe origin of Danny Vincent\'s powers remain unrevealed. His body actually exists in a "[[gravity well]]," somehow forcing his body out of synch with reality. In fact, without a way to control the gravity field around him, Danny would implode, drawing him and anything within an eight-mile (13&nbsp;km) radius into a miniature [[black hole]]. Because of the intense gravitational forces that are a part of his body, anyone who comes into unprotected contact with his skin will experience severe disorientation and nausea.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nDanny wears a special mechanical belt to regulate his powers; it monitors and synchronizes his contact with the world around him. By adjusting this belt, Danny can avoid most kinds of attacks, deflect projectiles, walk on walls and ceilings, lessen his rate of falling, and even phase through objects.\n\nJunta has a small floating \'\'\'servo-tech\'\'\' robot in his house programmed with his mother\'s memories and speech patterns, and which speaks only in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. According to him he "salvaged" it while working in Latveria, the homeland of [[Doctor Doom]]. This, of course, is a lie.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n{{refend}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://phonogram.us/comics/crew/danny.htm Digital Priest: Junta]\n*[http://www.marvelcomics.com/universe/Junta Marvel Universe entry on Junta]  \n*[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Queen_Divine_Justice Marvel Universe.com entry: Queen Divine Justice]\n\n{{Black Panther}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Christopher Priest]]\n[[Category:Comic book sidekicks]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1999]]\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]'

Fred has a blue dragon suit built for him by Hiro which allows him to leap great distances and shoot fire. During the movie Fred\'s friends learn that he is actually incredibly wealthy, and he provides the secret base (his huge house), financial support, and necessary training for them to become superheroes. In the post-credits scene, Fred accidentally opens a secret door in his home, in which he finds superhero costumes and equipment. Fred then finds out these belong to his father (voiced by [[Stan Lee]] and animated in his likeness), a retired superhero, when he unexpectedly returns from his vacation. As they embrace each other, he says that he and Fred have much to talk about.\n\n===Television===\nFred appears in \'\'[[Big Hero 6: The Series]]\'\', voiced by [[Brooks Wheelan]].<ref>{{cite news|title=\'Big Hero 6\': Maya Rudolph & More Reprise Roles for Disney XD Animated Series|url=http://deadline.com/2016/11/big-hero-6-maya-rudolph-jamie-chung-reprise-roles-disney-xd-animated-series-1201847587/|work=Deadline|accessdate=November 3, 2016|date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> In the first episode, "Baymax Returns", Fred reveals his full name as \'\'\'Frederick Frederickson IV\'\'\' (retconning the promotional material).

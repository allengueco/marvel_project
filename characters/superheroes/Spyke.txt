Created by writer [[Robert N. Skir]] and artist [[Steven E. Gordon]], he first appeared in "Speed And Spyke", episode #5 (December 9, 2000), where he was voiced by [[Neil Denis]].\n\nSpyke is a high-school freshman with the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability to project spikes out of his body.\n\nThe character was originally created as a way to diversify the show\'s X-Men roster. It was important to the show\'s creators, [[The WB Television Network|the WB network]] (who ran the show) and [[Marvel Comics]] to have an African American in the show. According to the show\'s [[Television producer|producer]] [[Boyd Kirkland]], turning [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] (the first Black male X-Man) into a teenager would not have worked.<ref name="Milk">"[https://web.archive.org/web/20050219193718/http://news.toonzone.net/2000/oct/20/spyke.php Milk: It Does a Body Good]", http://www.toonzone.net/, posted October 20, 2000, accessed October 26, 2006.</ref> Initially, Spyke was intended to be the team\'s muscle and looked closer to how he looked in season four, but Marvel decided they didn\'t like the "monster" angle and he was given a much more normal look{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}.

MARROW?]", http://www.comicscontinuum.com/, posted December 2, 2000, accessed September 23, 2006.</ref>\n\n==Character biography==\nEvan Daniels was born in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] to an unnamed father and Vivian Daniels. His mutant abilities are first noticed at his high school basketball game by his Aunt Ororo (aka [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] a longtime member of the [[X-Men]]), and his teammate Pietro. The next night Storm, along with [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]], approached Evan\'s parents about his mutant powers and attending [[X-Mansion|Xavier\'s School]]. Evan angrily declines on his own behalf and leaves.\n\nHe goes to his school to catch the thief who keeps breaking into his locker. It is revealed that Pietro is not only the thief, but a mutant with super speed powers. Pietro, who renames himself [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], breaks into all the lockers in the school and lets Evan take the heat as he escapes prosecution. Only when [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] uses his pull to help Evan get out of prison does he join the X-Men and the school under the code name Spyke. Spyke settles the score with Quicksilver when he, Cyclops, and Jean defeat the speedy mutant. Spyke is cleared of all charges when he catches Quicksilver\'s arrogant confession on tape.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Spykeuprising.jpg|thumb|left|Spyke in a scene from the X-Men Evolution episode \'\'\'Uprising\'\'\'.]] -->\nDuring his tenure with the X-Men, Spyke didn\'t want any special treatment from anyone at the school because he was Storm\'s nephew. Though he liked being an X-Man and thought of them as his family, Spyke at times acted selfishly and inconsiderate of others. Spyke would goof around in class and on at least one occasion ditched school mid-class to go skateboarding with his human friends. He also was late for several training exercises in the [[Danger Room]] resulting in him getting reprimanded by Storm and causing several X-Kids to fail in their training exercise because Spyke was not there to back them up. If not for him saving Storm\'s life from the [[Hungan (TV character)|Hungan]], Spyke would have been sent home to his parents due to his lack of concern for school and DR training.\n\nAfter he and the other X-Men were discovered to be mutants, Spyke grew angry at how they were being treated. After drinking Pow-R8, an energy drink that was toxic to mutants even by touching it, Spyke found out he could not retract or fully control his spikes. After seeing how cruelly he was treated because of his condition, Spyke joined the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] (a group of mutants who could not "pass" for human and so were driven underground) because he wanted to fight for mutants who looked different from normal humans. Storm did not take this well and tried to convince Spyke to come back, but he refused.\n\nWhen Evan returned later in the series, he had mutated even further, and now most of his upper body was covered by [[armadillo]]-type bone-plates except for his face and below the waist, and with the new ability to heat up the bone spikes he creates. During this time, Spyke began using his powers to fight against humans who were attempting to commit [[hate crime]]s against the Morlocks and mutants in general. These actions eventually led to him being the target of a group of anti-mutant bigots, led by [[List of X-Men: Evolution characters#Other villains|Duncan Matthews]]. Attacked with electrical mining guns, Spyke was cornered, but the Morlocks and X-Men stepped in and defeated Duncan and his accomplices, who were arrested by the police shortly after the battle was over. When Storm tried to persuade him once again to return to the institute, Spyke said the Morlocks needed him more and chose to remain with them.\n\nHe later helped out in destroying the Pyramids surfaced by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Spyke is last seen in a group photo with the future X-Men, the [[New Mutants]] and their unaffiliated allies. In this photo, he is wearing the bottom half of his X-Men costume, which may mean he has finally returned to the X-Men.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nSpyke can extend or retract [[bone]] spikes that grow inside his body. He may shoot them out or bring them out to grab and hold. He also needs to drink milk to replace the calcium that he loses when using his powers.<ref name="Milk"/> Spyke, an expert [[Skateboarding|skateboarder]], integrated his skateboarding prowess into battles. His body also seals the wounds caused by projecting his spikes with no visible scarring.\n\nIn the later episodes as his mutation evolved, Spyke gained the ability to heat up the ends of the spikes, increasing their damage potential, and his strength is almost twice that of an average human. He  now also has protective plates form around his body, but is unable to retract them. He also gained the ability to extend small spikes on his feet to scale and stick to walls.\n===Other Versions===\n\'\'\'Earth-616\'\'\'\nDavid Evan Munroe Jr. was born in New Jersey to an unknown father and Vivian Munroe (Storm\'s father\'s sister). Vivian named her son David, after Ororo\xe2\x80\x99s father, who had died too soon. Unfortunately, she later became a drug addict and eventually died of HIV, leaving young David in the care of his loving grandparents. As of yet David hasn\'t manifested any mutant powers. He also has yet to join the X-Men and has only recently met Storm in this universe.\n\n==In other media==\n===Films===\n* In the movie \'\'[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]\'\', a "Spike" character portrayed by [[Lance Gibson]] appeared in a battle with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], where he was depicted with the ability to extrude bony spikes from his flesh and hurl them with great speed and force. The battle culminates in a mutual stabbing.\n* A character named \'\'\'Daniels\'\'\' appears in [[X-Men: Days of Future Past]] portrayed by [[Jaa Smith-Johnson]], is probable based in Spyke from [[X-Men Evolution]]. Daniels is a mutant who fought in the Vietnam War. In 1973, Daniels is first shown as a mutant soldier in Saigon part of a military team along with Toad, Ink and Havok about to be appropriated by William Stryker on behalf of Trask Industries\' mutant research program. During Mystique\'s fight to rescue them, Daniels used his mutant powers to put some of the soldiers to sleep. He leaves Vietnam with the others soon afterwards, returning to the United States.\n\n===Other appearances===\n*A version of Spyke appeared in the X-Babies Stars Reborn as an evil, indestructible X-Baby.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of X-Men: Evolution characters]]\n* [[List of Marvel Comics characters]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.toonzone.net/xmenevo/bios/heroes/spyke/ Spyke\'s Profile at Marvel Animation Age]\n{{X-Men media}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2000]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Fictional basketball players]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Male characters in animation]]\n[[Category:X-Men: Evolution characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]'

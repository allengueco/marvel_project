Her first appearance was in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' vol. 1 #51.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nJones was once a trauma nurse at a [[Brooklyn]] hospital. Her husband was a police officer who was killed when he was walking home from a parents' night with their son, Timmy, at his school. They were caught in the middle of a drug war. One of the bullets nearly severed Timmy's spine, resulting in years of physical therapy to learn to walk again. As a result of that night, Charlotte became a police officer herself. She and Timmy live with her mother-in-law in a small apartment.\n\nIt was in this capacity that Jones first met the winged mutant named [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]], a member of the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] who had only recently fought off the mental manipulations of the eternal mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Archangel saved Jones from plummeting to her death after her police helicopter was struck by a news chopper, and then saved her again the next day from an ambush by a street gang.{{issue|date=April 2013}} Jones was later captured by the psychic vampires known as the Ravens who sought to make Archangel one of their number by forcing him to feed on Jones' life energy. However, Jones managed to free Archangel, and the Ravens were defeated with the assistance of X-Factor and two members of the [[X-Men]], the mutant techno-wizard [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] and the sonic-screaming [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]].{{issue|date=April 2013}} As a result of their brief psychic linking, Archangel admitted that it was Jones' courage that helped him overcome the Ravens' control. In his initial visit after the vampiric incident, Archangel bonds with Timmy, promising to take him flying. He does take Charlotte flying, to work. On the way they buzz [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and his girlfriend, Opal.{{issue|date=April 2013}} Subsequently, Jones and Archangel began to see each other socially, and the two began to fall in love, something her mother predicted would happen.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nJones later clashed with [[Magistrates]] from the island nation of [[Genosha]] who had come to the U.S. to reclaim escaped mutate Jenny Ransome. During a firefight with the Magistrates, Jones' partner was killed. Following them into the sewers, she was saved by Forge who provided her with an X-Men training costume. This proved a snug fit but afforded Jones a great degree of resistance to physical injury.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Breaking up and helping out===\nJones and Archangel would eventually end their relationship after Archangel rejoins the X-Men, but Jones still remained an ally to the mutant heroes. Later, after Jones had been promoted to Detective, she passes information to Cable about a troubled member of his X-Force team, [[Shatterstar]].<ref>''X-Force'' #59 (October 1996)</ref>\n\nShe is forced to betray the X-Man named Iceman and the mutant doctor [[Cecilia Reyes]] to cyborg [[Sentinel (comics)|Prime Sentinels]] from Operation: Zero Tolerance, a government-sponsored anti-mutant strikeforce headed up by the android [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]. Bastion had abducted Jones' son, leaving her with no other choice. Her son was eventually rescued by members of the X-Men shortly before OZT was shut down.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nAround this time, Jones decides to convey some information about a [[Gene Nation]] massacre to the X-Men. Wolverine, Storm and Cannonball show up. She discreetly ushers them into the city morgue. Supposedly all the dead people had simply stopped with no signs of death. This information comes into doubt as Wolverine soon discovers the morgue attendant himself had been killed and replaced by Gene Nation member ''Sack''. A battle in the morgue breaks out against multiple members of Gene Nation.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Bonding===\n\nLater, while pursuing a drug pusher named Rufus Delgado, she and Rufus unwittingly stumbled into the secret base of the Neo, a race of superior mutants who were waging a war against the X-Men. Jones and Delgado were affected by the powers of the Neo named [[Tartarus (comics)|Tartarus]] and his sister Elysia, which caused them to experience their greatest fear and greatest desire respectively. For Jones, it was the fear of falling victim to a criminal. For Delgado, it was his desire of gaining dominance over his long-time nemesis Jones. The result was a physical merging of the two into a two-torsoed winged demonic amalgam of a creature, with Delgado's personality dominant. Delgado subsequently struck a secret deal with the Neo Rax, who sought to usurp control of the Neo from their then-leader Domina. After the X-Men invaded the Neo's stronghold, Delgado was killed when he was decapitated by the feral X-Man [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. A ceasefire was eventually called between the Neo and the X-Men, and Jones was restored to her normal self.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Back on the Job===\n\nJones continues to serve as a detective with the [[NYPD|New York Police Department]], and remains a steadfast ally of the X-Men.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nSergeant Jones was with the X-Man known as [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] shortly after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] when he goes to the apartment of a former mutant named [[Hannah Levy]]. She used to be able to eat only insects; she feared they had returned to eat her.<ref>''House of M: The Day After'' #1, January 2006</ref>\n\nJones is also with Bishop when he approaches the Metropolitan Correctional Facility to check on the [[Shi'ar]] Death Commados. They were being held for murdering most of the Grey family line; this was done to prevent the rise of the destructive Phoenix entity{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe Death Commandos escape. In the ensuing firefight, Jones is swatted at, and seemingly, into a dimensional portal that the Commando Deathcloak manipulates. She is later seen recovering in the hospital during Bishop's visit.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Days of Future Past===\nCharlotte appears in the bleak ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' story as a courier for food and supplies for mutants.  She is allied with [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] and [[Leech (comics)|Leech]]. It is hinted that her son was killed when the Sentinels took over.  She is captured by Citizen V and has no choice but to betray her allies.<ref>Wolverine: Days of Future Past #1</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, Charlotte}}\n[[Category:Fictional nurses]]\n[[Category:Fictional New York City Police Department officers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"

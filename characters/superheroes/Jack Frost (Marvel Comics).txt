b'{{Notability|date=August 2018}}\n\'\'\'Jack Frost\'\'\' is the name of two unrelated [[Character (arts)|fictional]] characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first Jack Frost was published by Marvel\'s 1940s forerunner [[Timely Comics]] during the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of comic books]].\n\n==Publication history==\nMarvel Comics\' first character named Jack Frost outwardly recalls the [[folklore|folklorish]] spirit of winter [[Jack Frost]]. [[First appearance|First appearing]] in \'\'[[U.S.A. Comics]]\'\' #1 ([[cover-date]]d August 1941), from Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]], he was one of the first creations of future Marvel editor-in-chief and publisher [[Stan Lee]],<ref name="lee">[http://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lee_s.htm Stan Lee] at the [[Lambiek Comiclopedia]]</ref> who collaborated with [[penciler]] [[Charles Wojtkoski]]. In \'\'[[Marvel Premiere]]\'\' #29 (April 1976), he was [[retconned]] to have been a member of the stateside [[World War II]]-era superhero team the [[Liberty Legion]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Jack Frost (Golden Age)===\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=JackFrost_Marvel.jpg\n|caption=Detail from cover of \'\'The Invaders\'\' #6 (May 1976).<br>Art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].\n|character_name=Jack Frost\n|real_name=Unrevealed<br><small>(possibly Jack Frost)</small>\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=\'\'[[U.S.A.

He resembles a young man made of ice, and can create and withstand extremely cold temperatures and generate large amounts of ice. During [[World War II]], he joined with other superheroes to form the team [[Liberty Legion]] and protect the United States from [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] home-front infiltration. The Liberty Legion was initially assembled by [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] to rescue the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] brainwashed by the [[Red Skull]]. With the Legion, Jack Frost battled [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], and protected bystanders from shrapnel with an ice umbrella.<ref>\'\'Marvel Premiere\'\' #29; \'\'Invaders\'\' #6; \'\'Marvel Premiere\'\' #30</ref>\n\nJack Frost appeared in the modern era, where it was explained he had sacrificed himself by melding with an Arctic "ice-worm" monster in order to neutralize it and keep it from possibly devastating humanity. Jack Frost was briefly freed during an encounter with [[Captain America]] before willingly being swallowed by and melding with the ice-worm once more.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #384 (April 1991)</ref> Marvel\'s [[mythological]] character [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in this issue speculated that this Jack Frost may be the diminutive child of a [[Norse mythology]] [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost giant]].\n{{-}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nJack Frost has the ability to generate sub-freezing temperatures.  Combined with ambient water vapor, he can create snow, sleet, and ice for various effects such as propelling snow flurries at hurricane wind-speeds or fashioning ice into various simple constructs such as spheres, bridges, or walls.  He also has superhuman stamina and durability. Jack Frost has bluish-white skin that glistens from the glaze of frost that covers it. His skin temperature is {{convert|32|\xc2\xb0F|\xc2\xb0C}}.\n\n==Related characters==\n* In modern Marvel continuity, an unrelated, human scientist, Professor Gregor Shapanka, using technological means to generate incapacitating ice which he first planned to use to prolong life, became the [[supervillain]] Jack Frost. He was introduced as an [[antagonist]] of the [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]], as he was a former Stark employee who was fired for attempted robbery.<ref>\'\'[[Tales of Suspense]]\'\' #45 (Sept. 1963)</ref> He later took on the name [[Blizzard (comics)#Gregor Shapanka|Blizzard]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Jack_Frost_(Earth-616) Jack Frost] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/j/jackfrost.htm Golden Age Jack Frost at International Hero]\n\n{{Jack Frost}}\n{{GoldenAge}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1941]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with ice or cold abilities]]\n[[Category:Golden Age superheroes]]\n[[Category:Jack Frost]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Timely Comics characters]]'

His family also owned a large tea estate, where they all lived.\n\nHe was popular among girls because of his good looks. When his journalist brother [[Sanjit Shaara|Sanjit]] disappears, Neal decides to investigate, against his parents\' wishes. Neal is shadowed by his father\'s best detective [[Karima Shapandar]], and after Karima saves him from a group of thugs, the two began a romantic relationship while they search for Neal\'s missing brother.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #100. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Karima turned into a Prime Sentinel===\nThey are ultimately captured by the [[villain]] [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], who plans to turn them into [[Prime Sentinels]] as he has done to Sanjit. However, the shock of the transformation causes his latent mutant powers to manifest, the power to generate and control solar plasma and heat.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #103. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSanjit is able to disable the other Sentinels, but is fatally wounded in the attempt. Karima, who is able to temporarily rebel against her programming, tells Neal to leave her, as her own transformation process commences, which will result in her killing him when the transformation is complete.<ref name=XMen104-105>\'\'X-Men\'\' #104-105. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Joining The X-Men===\nNeal was now lost, alone and with strange powers that he neither comprehends or wants. Neal contacts goes to see family friend [[Moira MacTaggert]] on [[Muir Island]], and he meets the X-Men, although he does not know this when he first meets them. Later, the X-Men revealed themselves, when they used their powers to stop [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] when his [[techno-organic]] virus runs out of control. Neal is initially frightened, but is eventually convinced to join the team. He chooses the codename Thunderbird, becoming the third bearer of that name so after the Proudstar brothers. He later adopted a more armored yellow and red uniform with wire mesh padding.<ref name=XMen104-105/>\n\n===Psylocke===\nWhile with the X-Men, Thunderbird struggles with his fear of killing or hurting someone with his plasma. In addition, he also falls in love with the X-Man [[Psylocke]], even though she is in a relationship with [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]]. Thunderbird and Psylocke often engage in flirtatious behavior in front of Archangel, who makes his displeasure felt to Thunderbird. The couple eventually breaks up, and Psylocke pursues a romantic relationship with Thunderbird.<ref name=Weiner>Weiner, Robert G. (October 17, 2007).

He also introduces him to the game of cricket. During one of their conversations, he says that though he is happy with Psylocke, he still retains his feelings for Karima, who is a Prime Sentinel.{{issue|date=February 2017}}\n\nThunderbird\'s lack of control over his powers often caused problems during combat. He refrains from using them on his opponents due the fear of killing them. Archangel, who bears animus toward him because of his breakup with Betsy, mocks him and questions his place in the X-Men.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\n===\'\'X-Treme X-Men\'\'===\nA short while, Thunderbird and five other X-Men formed a splinter group of X-Men dubbed the [[X-Treme X-Men]], cutting all ties with the rest of the team while searching for [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]\'s Diaries. He trains with Psylocke to gain better control of his powers, and learns to use only a small amount of plasma to blind or singe his opponents. Psylocke dies at the hands of [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]], leaving behind a grief-stricken Thunderbird.{{issue|date=December 2012}}<ref name=Weiner/>\n\nFor a time he is seen working with the X-Man from the future, [[Bishop (comics)|Lucas Bishop]], another mutant with energy-related powers, in an attempt to overcome his fears and gain greater control over his powers. He comes to think of Bishop as his mentor. After Psylocke\'s death, he begins questioning the purpose of his life. Bishops tells him that while none of the X-Men are mentioned in the history books of his time, Neal is, a revelation that greatly motivates Neal.{{issue|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Lifeguard===\nSome time after, Neal started a relationship with [[Lifeguard (comics)|Heather Cameron]], who was also known as Lifeguard. She and her brother Davis (who would become [[Slipstream (comics)|Slipstream]]) joined the offshoot group of the X-Men. After the inter-dimensional Invasion at Madripoor by the villain [[Khan (comics)|Khan]], Thunderbird and Lifeguard left to search for her brother Slipstream, who left the team.<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]] (w), [[Larocca, Salvador]] (a). \'\'[[X-Treme X-Men]]\'\' #1-6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===X-Corporation===\nNeal and Heather would later be seen as a member of the [[X-Corporation]] in Singapore, although Slipstream was nowhere to be seen. However this was short-lived as there was a synchronized attack on several of the X-Corporation offices after the catastrophic events of M-Day, leading Cyclops to call for the disbanding of all offices. Whether they aborted their search for Slipstream, or did find him, is not yet known.<ref>\'\'X-Treme X-Men\'\' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Current status===\nIn the "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]" storyline, it is seen in the 198 files, that he is one of the few mutants to retain their powers after the events of M-Day.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThunderbird has the ability to transform the molecules of his body into solar plasma, enabling him to convert portions of himself into thermodynamic energy furnaces that release luminescent radiance, pyrotechnic displays, concentrated plasma beams, shaped plasma charges that can deflect solid matter or displace volumes of air on impact for a heatless release of concussive force, and explosive thrust from his legs for flight or projection of focused blasts, flashes, or explosive spheres. Because plasma is a superheated, ionized state of matter, it can melt or destroy most objects, with the exception of [[adamantium]]. Thunderbird can also use his power to generate sufficient propulsive thrust to fly at supersonic speeds. In his initial appearances, Thunderbird is relatively unskilled in the use of his powers, but receives further training from Psylocke and Bishop.{{issue|date=February 2017}}\n\nDuring his time being mentored by Bishop, he achieves greater control over his powers, learning how to use his blasts to only single targets. He can also use only a small amount to create a blinding flash.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|2000s|Fictional characters|Superhero fiction|Comics}}\n* {{Marvelwiki|Thunderbird_(Neal_Shaara)|Thunderbird (Neal Shaara)}}\n* [http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/thunderbird-iii UncannyXmen.net Spotlight on Thunderbird III]\n\n{{X-Men}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2000]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with fire or heat abilities]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Indian superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Indian descent]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]'

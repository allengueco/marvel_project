The character first appears in [[Young Avengers|\'\'Young Avengers\'\']] #5, and is the third character and second android character published by Marvel with the superhero name Vision. He is a combination of the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|original android Vision\'s]] program files and the armor and brain patterns of [[Iron Lad]].\n\n==Publication history==\nVision first appeared in \'\'Young Avengers\'\' #5 (Aug. 2005) and was created by [[Allan Heinberg]] and [[Jim Cheung]].\n \nThe exact details of the character\'s personality and mental make-up vary from writer to writer. While some writers, such as Heinberg and [[Dan Slott]], write him as an entirely new character,{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} other writers like [[Brian Michael Bendis]] (during the "Collective" storyline) and [[Ed Brubaker]] (in \'\'[[Captain America: Reborn]]\'\') write him as if he is the original Vision in a new body (or at least has access to the original Vision\'s memories).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Vision is a fusion of the old Vision\'s operating systems and the armor of adventurer Iron Lad, a teenage version of [[Kang the Conqueror]] who arrives in the present. Through this merger, Iron Lad is able to access plans the Vision had created in the event of the Avengers\' defeat. He uses these plans to assemble a new team of "[[Young Avengers]]". When Iron Lad is forced to remove his armor to stop Kang the Conqueror from tracking him, the Vision\'s operating system causes the armor to become a sentient being.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} When Iron Lad leaves the time period, he leaves the armor behind with the Vision\'s operating system activated.\n\nThe new Vision opts to stay with the Young Avengers and serve as a mentor for them, though it is later revealed that (due to having Iron Lad\'s brainwave patterns as the basis for his personality) he is with the group due to his growing feelings of affection towards [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie Lang]], the superhero known as Stature.<ref name="youngavengers11">\'\'Young Avengers\'\' #11 (May 2006), Marvel Comics.</ref> After the events of the "[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]" storyline, the Vision travels the world posing as different people in order to gain a better understanding of who he is. He then finds Cassie and declares his love, and states he has adopted the name "Jonas".<ref>\'\'Young Avengers Presents\'\' #4 (April 2008), Marvel Comics.</ref> During a later battle between the alien [[Skrulls]] and the Avengers, the Vision is shot through the head.<ref>\'\'Secret Invasion\'\' #3 (Apr. 2008), Marvel Comics.</ref> He survives and joins with [[Nick Fury]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] alongside the other Young Avengers.<ref>\'\'Secret Invasion\'\' #5 (June 2008), Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHe joins the new lineup of the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]], along with Stature.<ref>\'\'Mighty Avengers\'\' #21, Marvel Comics.</ref> They opt to keep their dual memberships in the Avengers and the Young Avengers a secret, in order to hunt for the Scarlet Witch (really Loki in disguise), who arranged for the roster to form. They ultimately tell their teammates this when Loki reveals his impersonation of Wanda and confront him. When the group ultimately disbands following the events of the "Siege", both rejoin the Young Avengers full-time.\n\nIn \'\'Avengers: Children\'s Crusade\'\', Cassie is killed by [[Doctor Doom]], and Iron Lad decides to take her body into the future to be revived. Jonas protests, reasoning that such an action is more in line with Kang\'s manipulation of time than what Cassie would want, and Iron Lad murders him in a fit of jealous anger. Although his teammates contemplate rebuilding him, they decide against it, both because they lack the 30th-century technology to do so and because, even with their access to his back-ups, the lack of a back-up immediately prior to his death would mean that they would have to tell him about Cassie\'s death all over again. [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate]], Cassie\'s best friend, prefers to believe that he and Cassie are somehow together wherever they are now.<ref>\'\'Avengers: Children\'s Crusade\'\' #9, Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nVision is able to use Iron Lad\'s neuro-kinetic armor to recreate the former Vision\'s abilities, including superhuman strength, density manipulation, and flight. The yellow solar cell on his forehead can also emit a beam of infrared and microwave radiation. He is also capable of energy and holographic manipulation, [[shapeshifting]] and time travel.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Jonas_(Earth-616) Vision (Jonas)] at the Marvel Wiki\n*[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vision/4005-1504/ Vision (Jonas)] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Mighty Avengers}}\n{{Young Avengers}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2005]]\n[[Category:Fictional androids]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can turn intangible]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with density control abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Fictional technopaths]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics titles]]\n[[Category:Robot superheroes]]'

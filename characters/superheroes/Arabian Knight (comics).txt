He was a good hand-to-hand combatant and was an exceptional swordsman, particularly in the use of the scimitar. He possesses three magical weapons: a [[Flying carpet|magic carpet]], a [[gold]]en [[scimitar]] emitting beams of magical force, and a mind-controlled belt/sash. Indeed, \'\'all\'\' three items respond, exclusively, to his mental commands. He discovered his weapons, which had belonged to a 13th-century ancestor, in an underground tomb in the [[Egypt]]ian desert. The magic carpet and sash are formed from a material that is virtually indestructible, resisting fire, and even bullets. The carpet permitted him to travel, flying, at high speeds and altitudes, while the belt/sash magically elongates to approximately {{convert|40|ft|m}} in length (almost 10 times its typical length), and can serve as a weapon (whip), or as a climbing rope, or to capture and restrain his foes. The golden scimitar, in addition to firing destructive blasts, will "backfire" against any other person who may attempt to wield it.\n\nThe second Arabian Knight had a magical scimitar, magic armor, and a magic carpet of his own. He apparently had nothing to do with the first or third Knight, so the origins of his magical scimitar, armor and carpet have yet to be explained.\n\nThe third Arabian Knight revealed that the flying carpet used by the first Arabian Knight was unraveled and made into an indestructible uniform that responds to his thoughts. He still uses the magic scimitar and wears the red magic sash around his waist, and the uniform serves as body armor that protects him from harm and allows him to fly.\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=September 2017}}\n[[Comic Book Resources]] placed the original Arabian Knight as one of the superheroes Marvel wants you to forget.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Gary|title=15 Superheroes Marvel Wants You To Forget|url=http://www.cbr.com/superheroes-marvel-wants-you-to-forget/|website=CBR|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/arabianknight.htm|Arabian Knight (Abdul Qamar)}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/arabianknightbp.htm|Arabian Knight (Iraqi)}}\n* {{Marvelwiki|Arabian_Knight_(Abdul_Qamar)|Arabian Knight (Abdul Qamar)}}\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/a/arabianknight.htm Marvel Directory: Arabian Knight I]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165629/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001447030.cfm Wizard Magazine: Interview with Mike Perkins, Arabian Knight III]\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Al Milgrom]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Mantlo]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1981]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2006]]\n[[Category:Fictional Arabs]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]'

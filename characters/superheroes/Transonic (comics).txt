The character first appeared in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' #526, in the first chapter of the "Five Lights" storyline, and was created by [[Matt Fraction]] and [[Kieron Gillen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/6433-kieron-gillen-introduces-the-five-lights-of-generation-hope.html|title=Kieron Gillen Introduces the Five Lights of GENERATION HOPE|last=Ching|first=Albert|date=November 3, 2010|website=Newsarama|access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref> She is one of the "Five Lights"\xe2\x80\x94a group of mutants who manifested their abilities after the events of "[[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]]".\n\n==Publication history==\nTransonic first appeared in \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' as a teenager who was having difficulty completing, let alone coping with, her mutation. Following her introduction, she, along with [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], [[Velocidad (comics)|Velocidad]], [[Oya (comics)|Oya]], [[Kenji Uedo|Zero]], and [[Primal (comics)|Primal]], began to feature in the series \'\'[[Generation Hope (comics)|Generation Hope]]\'\'.<ref>\'\'Generation Hope\'\' #1 (2011)</ref>  She continues to make appearances in \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' as well.\n\nLaurie is studious and intelligent and often cites logic as the rationale for her actions. She is often annoyed when her teammates, notably Velocidad, confuse things such as Ethics and Morals.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===The First Light===\nLaurie Tromette is a 19-year-old college student living in Vancouver when her X-gene first manifests. At first, her mutation takes no real form. She experiences hair loss, skin changes, and flu-like symptoms, but according to Cyclops, "nothing resembling anything." She becomes so distressed that she decides to commit suicide by jumping off of a building. In an effort to save Laurie\'s life, Hope jumps off the building with her\xe2\x80\x94touching Laurie and activating her power of flight.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #526 (2010)</ref> Laurie pledges to follow Hope and eventually moves to Utopia with the rest of the [[X-Men]].<ref name=GH4>\'\'Generation Hope\'\' #4 (2011)</ref>\n\nAfter moving to Utopia, Laurie, like the rest of the Lights, both trains with Hope and takes classes with the rest of the student-aged mutant population.  When Hope confronts [[Emma Frost]] during a class, Laurie is conflicted about following Hope from the room.  While she ultimately goes with her team, Laurie is apologetic toward her teacher and is upset by her team\'s actions.<ref name=GH5>\'\'Generation Hope\'\' #5 (2011)</ref>\n\nLaurie contracts the "mutant flu" during the events of the \'\'Quarantine\'\' storyline.<ref name=UXMEN531>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #531</ref> She presumably recovers like the rest of the X-Men when the virus is disabled.<ref name=UXMEN534>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #534</ref>\n\n[[Image:Transonic transformet Generation Hope 7.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Transonic transformed while rescuing [[Oya (comics)|Oya]]. Art by [[Salva Espin]], [[Jim Charalampidis]] and [[David Sharpe (artist)|Dave Sharpe]]]]\n\nWhen a Sixth Light is located in [[Germany]], Hope and the Lights (including Transonic) go to retrieve it. However, they find that the Light is actually an unborn infant too scared to leave its mother\'s womb, who is able to knock unconscious or take control of anyone within his range. Laurie\'s powers appear to evolve, allowing her to transform into a flying mermaid-type form, which is able to fly through the affected area and into Kenji\'s telepathic protection before the infant can take control of her. The infant is eventually convinced to be born, and Hope touches him and stabilizes his mutation.<ref>\'\'Generation Hope\'\' vol. 1 #7</ref>\n\nBefore leaving Germany, however, Shadowcat informs Hope and the Lights that Teon\'s parents have sued for custody of their boy. Later, Teon gives a beautiful speech in court about how he is happier on Utopia with Hope than he would be with his parents, Kenji talks to Laurie about how Hope has changed all of the Lights. Specifically, he wonders aloud if Teon truly is happier on Utopia, or if he is faking it to remain close to Hope. The two agree that something is not right about it, and Kenji reveals that he had considered taking the codename \'\'Judas\'\' to counter their "messiah" Hope; Laurie wonders if they can both be Judas.<ref>\'\'Generation Hope\'\' vol. 1 #8</ref>\n\n===Schism===\nAs he returns from an obviously tiring mission, Wolverine encounters Hope and the Lights, including Transonic, awaiting his return so they can start Combat Training class. Wolverine cancels the class he had no knowledge of, and instead asks them if they shouldn\'t be doing something more age appropriate.\n\nLaurie is one of the X-Men to attend the opening of a Mutant History Museum, a group that includes several adult and younger mutants. She takes Idie to look at several of the exhibits, until they meet up with Kenji. Laurie and Kenji begin to argue about the recent events involving [[Quentin Quire]] as Idie quietly slips away. When the Museum is attacked by the new Hellfire Club, Laurie loses her head and tells Idie to run. Most of the X-Men are quickly defeated, and Laurie among them. Later, after Idie "murders" the Hellfire grunts, Laurie is seen outside arguing with Hope, who accuses Laurie of losing her head in battle instead of acting like a soldier. Laurie fires back, however, stating that she\'s only a soldier when Hope is around to guide her. When Zero asks Oya if she is okay, she mortifies Laurie, Hope, and the other Lights by only asking if there is anyone else she needs to kill.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Schism\'\' #3</ref><ref>\'\'Generation Hope\'\' vol. 1 #10</ref>\n\n===Avengers vs. X-Men===\nDuring the war between the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the X-Men over Hope and the Phoenix Force, Laurie was accidentally teleported to [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] when trying to stop [[Doctor Strange]]. There, she was arrested under [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]]\'s orders, prompting [[Namor]] to attack Wakanda under the excuse of rescuing her.<ref>\'\'Avengers vs. X-Men\'\' #7</ref> Although Laurie has yet to appear on panel, the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning Roster lists her among the current students of the school, implying that she was released from Wakanda at some moment during or after the Avengers vs. X-Men war.<ref>\'\'Wolverine and the X-Men\'\' #25</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLaurie\'s primary ability is that of supersonic flight. Her body not only propels itself through the air at transonic speeds, but also possesses reactive properties that change her physical form to grant enhanced maneuverability.<ref name=GH4/> Her body has changed shape to become larger and winged (resembling a [[flying fish]]) when traveling at high altitudes<ref>\'\'Generation Hope\'\' #7 (2011)</ref> and missile-shaped when traveling at high speeds.<ref>\'\'Generation Hope\'\' #9 (2011)</ref>\n\nLaurie also possesses "generalized physiological enhancement".<ref name =GH4/> Besides her blue skin and somewhat scaly appearance, the extent of these enhancements has not been revealed.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/glossary/showentry.asp?fldAuto=2392 UncannyXmen.net Character Bio on Transonic]\n{{Portal bar|2010s|Fictional characters|Superhero fiction|Comics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Transonic}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2010]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]'

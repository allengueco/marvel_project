Sometime later, he became an agent for the British intelligence agency, [[MI6|MI-6]].

Tarr was attacked outside the embassy building where Shang-Chi was staying with friends. He escaped inside. Shang-Chi listened to him, learning of Freelance Restorations, then helped him rescue Mandy. The girl was safely spirited away and the cult\'s headquarters was destroyed without loss of any life. Unfortunately Mandy had been well brainwashed by the cult at this time and promises to kill Tarr. {{Issue|date=September 2009}}\n\nMandy is taken to Stormhaven Castle where several of Smith\'s colleagues attempt to bring her back to normalcy. This doesn\'t go as well, until an attack by the destructive villain [[Agent Syn]]. Tarr risks his life to save Mandy from Syn\'s fire.

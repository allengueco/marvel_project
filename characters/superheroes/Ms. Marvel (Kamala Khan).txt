Created by editors [[Sana Amanat]] and Stephen Wacker, writer [[G. Willow Wilson]] and artist [[Adrian Alphona]], Khan is Marvel\'s first [[Muslim]] character to headline her own comic book. Khan made her first appearance in \'\'[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]\'\' #14 (August 2013) before going on to star in the solo series \'\'[[Ms. Marvel]]\'\', which debuted in February 2014.\n\nWithin the [[Marvel Universe]], Khan is a teenage [[Pakistani American]] from [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] with [[shapeshifting]] abilities who discovers that she has [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] genes in the aftermath of the "[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]" storyline and assumes the mantle of \'\'\'Ms. Marvel\'\'\' from her [[Teen idol|idol]] [[Carol Danvers]] after Danvers becomes Captain Marvel. Marvel\'s announcement that a Muslim character would headline a comic book was met with widespread reaction and the first volume of \'\'Ms. Marvel\'\' won the [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story|best graphic story]] in 2015.\n\n==Publication history==\nIn November 2013, [[Marvel Comics]] announced that Kamala Khan, a teenage [[Islam in the United States|American Muslim]] from [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], would take over the comic book series \'\'[[Ms. Marvel]]\'\' beginning in February 2014.

Wilson, a convert to Islam, said "This is not evangelism. It was really important for me to portray Kamala as someone who is struggling with her faith." Wilson continued, "Her brother is extremely conservative, her mom is paranoid that she\'s going to touch a boy and get pregnant, and her father wants her to concentrate on her studies and become a doctor."<ref name="NYTimes" /> Amanat added, <blockquote>As much as Islam is a part of Kamala\xe2\x80\x99s identity, this book isn\'t preaching about religion or the Islamic faith in particular.

Wilson created the Inventor to be Khan\'s first arch rival in order to mirror Khan\'s own complexity. Wilson characterizes the Inventor, and the overall visual look of the opening story arc as "kooky and almost [[Hayao Miyazaki|Miyazaki]]-esque at times", owing to the art style of illustrator [[Adrian Alphona]], which balances the drama of the threats which Khan faces with the humor of Alphona\'s "tongue in cheek sight gags." During the storyline, Khan also [[team-up|teams-up]] with the X-Man [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] against the Inventor.

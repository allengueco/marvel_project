The original Hyperion made his debut in \'\'[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]\'\' #69 (Oct. 1969), created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]]. The alternate versions are each from a different dimension of the [[Marvel Multiverse]], and consist of both heroes and villains. The character is a [[pastiche]] of [[DC Comics|DC\']]s iconic hero [[Superman]].<ref>https://screenrant.com/characters-marvel-ripped-off-superman-copies/</ref>\n\nThe first Hyperion, Zhib-Ran, was a member of [[Squadron Sinister]], gathered by the cosmic [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to fight against a team of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] gathered by the time travelling [[Kang (comics)|Kang]]. The group later returned to fight the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] with the alien [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]] granting them additional super powers. The original Hyperion later learns that he\'s a duplicate version of Hyperion of Earth-712 created by the Grandmaster. For a while he replaced the Earth-712 version, but ultimately dies fighting against the Earth-712 Hyperion. A different Hyperion later appears with the latest Squadron Sinister but is defeated by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].\n\nTwo years after the creation of the Squadron Sinister, Marvel created a heroic version of the team, the [[Squadron Supreme]], of which Hyperion (Mark Milton) is a founding member. The Squadron later takes control of the United States, believing they could keep everyone safer by taking control of the nation. The desire for peace and control leads several members of the Squadron to [[brainwashing|brainwash]] several super villains and others who oppose their rule that becomes more and more totalitarian in nature. After a battle that costs [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Kyle Richmond (Earth-712)|Nighthawk]] his life, Hyperion realizes the errors of their approach and relinquishes control of the country. When the Earth-712 universe is destroyed by the [[Nth Man]] the Squadron Supreme ends up stranded in the Earth-616 universe.\n\nIn 2003 Marvel Comics launched \'\'[[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Supreme Power]]\'\', a new take on the Squadron Supreme universe, designated Earth-31916, where Hyperion is an alien baby sent to earth from a dying planet. The origin mirrors that of Superman, but Hyperion is found and raised by the United States Government to be a super powered operative. He later turns on the government and helps establish Earth-31916\'s first super hero team.\n\nYet another alternate Hyperion joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and later the Earth-616 version of the Squadron Supreme.\n\n==Publication history== \nThe first iteration of Hyperion, created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Sal Buscema]], debuted in \'\'[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]\'\' #69 as a member of the [[Squadron Sinister]].<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #69 (Oct. 1969)</ref> The team was loosely based on heroes from [[DC Comics]]\' [[Justice League of America]], with Hyperion based on [[Superman]].<ref>Interview with Roy Thomas and Jerry Bails in \'\'The Justice League Companion\'\' (2003) pp. 72\xe2\x80\x9373</ref>\n\nTwo years later, Thomas and penciller John Buscema created an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate]], heroic version of the Squadron Sinister called the Squadron Supreme, once again in the title \'\'[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]\'\',<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #85 (Feb. 1971)</ref> using characters with the same names as those of the Squadron Sinister (this caused confusion in Marvel\'s production department, as the covers of \'\'Avengers\'\' #85 and #141 claimed the issues featured appearances by the Squadron Sinister when it was in fact the Squadron Supreme that appeared in both issues). In the 12-issue \'\'Squadron Supreme\'\' miniseries (Sept. 1985 - Aug. 1986) [[Mark Gruenwald]] picked up from where Earth-712 was last seen in \'\'Defenders\'\' #114 and revealed this Hyperion\'s origins.\n\nThe character is re-imagined for Marvel\'s [[Marvel MAX|MAX]] imprint title \'\'[[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Supreme Power]]\'\', where he is an alien who has been raised by the government. This iteration received a spinoff miniseries, \'\'Supreme Power: Hyperion\'\', which showed a dystopian possible future.\n\nAnother Hyperion joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in [[Jonathan Hickman]]\'s \'\'The Avengers\'\' vol. 5, #1 (December 2012). Hickman described the decision to use a new Hyperion, rather than an existing one:\n\n<blockquote>This is yet another parallel universe Hyperion. This is not King Hyperion, or Supreme Power Hyperion, this is not Gruenwald\'s Hyperion. This is Hyperion without all that baggage. This is Hyperion with a fresh slate, for a very specific purpose. He comes out of what the big story is behind the whole Avengers three-year plan that I have. He\'s very important, very pivotal, and I think people are really going to dig where we go with that. He\'s not going to be our poor analogue for Superman.<ref name="HickmanAvengers">{{Cite web |last=Ching |first=Albert |title=Jonathan Hickman Brings the World to Marvel NOW!

However, their ways of ending corruption involved enslaving their own people in an effort to create order. When the people of the planet refused to blindly obey them, they used the Power Prism to destroy the planet, leaving Hyperion to search for another planet to inhabit.\n\n: Introduced in season one, he first appears in his self-titled episode "Hyperion" when the Avengers attempt to stop a cluster of planet-sized meteorites from striking the East Coast. First saving Manhattan from a meteor classified by [[Edwin Jarvis|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] as an \'Earth-Killer\' and when crashing the Avengers\' battle with [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]], Hyperion introduces himself to the Avengers when they encounter him in his citadel above the city. Though Hyperion orders his computer Quagmire to show his origin story, he leaves out the part where he enslaved his people, and claimed that his home world\'s destruction was the population\'s own fault. When he tried to kill Wrecker on the Golden Gate Bridge as he was trying to escape, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] stood in his way, believing that killing the bad guys was against the law. In a fit of rage, Hyperion fought the Avengers. While the other Avengers fought him, Iron Man used J.A.R.V.I.S. to hack the citadel\'s computer and found out about what Hyperion left out when he told the Avengers his origin, confirming that Hyperion was insane. Though defeated by the Avengers and placed in a special cell stating, Hyperion is later freed by the [[Red Skull|Iron Skull]] while offered a membership in the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] at the end of "Bring on the Bad Guys". In the episodes "The Ambassador" and "By the Numbers", Hyperion serves as a member of the Cabal while having the chance to take revenge on the Avengers, taking on either [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] or the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. But in the events of episodes "Exodus" and "The Final Showdown", he saved by Iron Man when he is almost killed by Iron Skull\'s trap, to which Hyperion and the other Cabal members aid the Avengers in defeating Red Skull.\n\n: Season two revealed that Hyperion\'s team did not perish, but instead, resided on ther planets waiting to reassemble again. In the episode "Nighthawk", Nighthawk appeared on Earth and mentioned about knowing of Hyperion\'s time with the Cabal and considered him the \'hammer\' of the group. Hyperion later appears on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Tri-Carrier and frees Nighthawk with the intent to reform their group. In the episode "The Dark Avengers", the [[Squadron Supreme]] have become Earth\'s guardians thanks to the power of the Reality Stone with Hyperion as leader and the Avengers are wanted felons. Hyperion attempts to use his super-breath to incapacitate the heroes. He realizes that reality is being rewritten again after a power anomaly causes [[Captain America]]\'s [[Captain America\'s shield|shield]] to reverts and throws the shield at Captain America in an attempt to kill, however, [[Iron Man]] saves Cap from falling to death and one of [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]\'s exploding arrows to the face soon takes out Hyperion. In the episode "Avengers\' Last Stand", Hyperion joins the Squadron Supreme into enacting Nighthawk\'s plot against the Avengers. In the episode "Avengers Underground", Hyperion annihilates the Atlantean soldiers that have been sent by Attuma while throwing one of them back into the ocean to tell Attuma what he just saw. [[Scott Lang|Ant-Man]] later transfers the Power Prism\'s powers to Captain America to turn the sun blue, which renders him powerless, so that [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] can defeat Hyperion. Nighthawk then teleports [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] and Hyperion to the tower where Hyperion absorbs Nuke\'s powers with the intent on destroying Earth. As Nighthawk prepares to leave Earth (yet, he is confronted by Iron Man), the rest of the team stops Hyperion from reaching the planet\'s core by fighting him until he fully runs out of power. With the Squadron Supreme defeated, Hyperion and his teammates are mentioned to have been remanded to a special section of the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].\n\n===Video games===\n*Hyperion is an unlockable character in the Facebook game \'\'[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]\'\'.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n*Hyperion is an unlockable character in the IOS/Android game \'\'[[Marvel: Future Fight]]\'\'.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n*Hyperion is available via DLC in \'\'[[Lego Marvel\'s Avengers]]\'\'.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n*The Earth-13034 version of Hyperion is a playable character in the IOS/Android game \'\'[[Marvel: Contest of Champions]]\'\'.<ref name="ContestofChampions">{{cite web|url=https://news.marvel.com/games/56467/entering-marvel-contest-champions-hyperion/|author=Ben Chabala|title=ENTERING MARVEL CONTEST OF CHAMPIONS: HYPERION|date=December 8, 2016|website=Marvel News|access-date=February 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Hyperion_%28Earth-712%29 Hyperion] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Mark_Milton_%28Earth-712%29 Hyperion of Earth-712] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Hyperion_%28Squadron_Sinister%29_%28Earth-616%29 Hyperion (Squadron Sinister version)] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Mark_Milton_%28Earth-4023%29 King Hyperion] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Hyperion_%28Zombie%29_%28Earth-616%29 Zombie Hyperion] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Marcus_Milton_%28Earth-13034%29 Hyperion of Earth-13034] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Squadron Supreme}}\n{{Eternals}}\n{{Thunderbolts}}\n{{Avengers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hyperion (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by John Buscema]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1969]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1971]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Eternals]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]'

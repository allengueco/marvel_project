The character has appeared as \'\'\'[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]\'\'\' and later \'\'\'[[Thunderstrike (comics)|Thunderstrike]]\'\'\'. The character was introduced as a supporting character in the \'\'Thor\'\' title, but continued in several other comic books, including the self-titled series \'\'Thunderstrike\'\' in 1993. Later interpretations of Thunderstrike would appear in both the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] and [[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]] Marvel Comics storylines, featuring the character\'s son, [[Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson)|Kevin Masterson]], as the hero.<ref>[http://insidepulse.com/2010/11/24/spoiler-warnings-new-thunderstrike-revealed-in-thunderstrike-1-by-tom-defalco/]</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nEric Masterson first appeared in \'\'Thor\'\' #391, as a supporting character. \'\'Thor\'\' #408 featured the merging of the character Eric Masterson with Thor, Masterson being utilized as the God of Thunder\'s alter ego until issue #432.<ref>http://www.immortalthor.net/thor421-430.html</ref> \'\'Thor\'\' #432 featured the character assuming the role of Thor, and appearing as the title character until \'\'Thor\'\' #459.<ref>http://www.immortalthor.net/thor431-440.html</ref>\n\nFollowing \'\'Thor\'\' #459, Masterson was introduced as "Thunderstrike" in the eponymous series starting in June [[1993 in comics|1993]]. The series lasted approximately two years. \'\'Thunderstrike\'\' ran for 24 issues, the series canceled in [[1995 in comics|September 1995]].

Roshell (i). "An A-Z Compedium of Earth\'s Mighiest Heroes" Avengers Casebook 1999 1 (1) (Feb 2000), Marvel Comics</ref> and crossover series [[Operation: Galactic Storm]]. Masterson also appeared in the mini-series \'\'[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]\'\' and \'\'[[The Infinity War|Infinity War]].\'\' Outside the many appearances in \'\'Thor\'\' and \'\'Avengers\'\', \'\'Thunderstrike\'\' was used to launch an [[ongoing series]] \'\'[[Blackwulf]]\'\', and a [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. \'\'[[Code: Blue|Code: B.L.U.E.]]\'\'\n\nIt was announced that the Thunderstrike character would be returning in a new miniseries by co-creators Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz in November 2010.<ref>http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2010/08/defalco-and-frenz-to-revive-thunderstrike/</ref> Promotionals leading into the event began in August depicting the mace stating "One will rise..." and "The World Still Needs Heroes."<ref>http://marvel.com/news/all.13544.the_world_still_needs_heroes</ref> Ultimately, the new Thunderstrike miniseries featured Eric Masterson\'s son, Kevin, in the role once inhabited by his father.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nEric Kevin Masterson was working as an architect when he met [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Masterson was injured by falling girders, and was taken to the hospital by Thor. Now on crutches, Masterson was attacked by [[Quicksand (comics)|Quicksand]], but saved by Thor.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #391-392</ref> Masterson was then abducted by [[Mongoose (comics)|Mongoose]]. Masterson accompanied Thor to the Black Galaxy, where he first met [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. Masterson was mortally wounded by Mongoose, and is given Thor\'s form and powers after the original is sealed in Eric\'s mind, by [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], to save Eric\'s life.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #405-408</ref> Recognizing that his new life as Thor was too dangerous for a child, Masterson gave up custody of his son Kevin to his ex-wife Marcy, reasoning that Kevin would be safer with her even if she was relatively ambivalent about her role as a mother.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #421</ref> Masterson was then separated from Thor by the [[Celestial (comics)|Red Celestial]].<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #423</ref> Shortly thereafter, Masterson saved Thor\'s life, and was merged with him again.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #425</ref> Masterson\'s son Kevin was captured by [[Ulik]] for [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. Thor freed Kevin and seemingly slew Loki in battle. [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]] separated Thor from Masterson, then banished Thor, and transformed Masterson into a new Thor.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #431-432</ref> He then met the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] as Leena Moran, and battled Ulik.<ref name="Thor #433">\'\'Thor\'\' #433</ref>\n\n[[Image:Thor433.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Eric Masterson as the new Thor on the cover of \'\'Thor\'\' #433. Art by Ron Frenz]]\nEric continues in the role of Thor, after having been given Mjolnir by Thor, who tells Eric to carry on as Earth\'s protector. Eric then returns to Earth and joins the Avengers in Thor\'s place.<ref name="Thor #433"/> Masterson revealed his double identity to [[Captain America]]. He then first visited [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], where he fought the [[Warriors Three]], [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], Heimdall, and [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]], while trying to discover the whereabouts of the real Thor. Masterson then helped rescue the sleeping Odin from [[Annihilus]].<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #434-435</ref> He teamed with [[Beta Ray Bill]] and [[Alternative versions of Thor#Dargo Ktor|Dargo Ktor]] as the "Thor Corps" against [[Zarrko]] and Loki.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #439-441</ref> During his time with the Avengers as Thor, he aids them in such battles as [[Operation: Galactic Storm|the Kree/Shi\'ar war]]<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #445</ref> and the [[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]] crisis, being one of only three heroes at the conclusion of that battle to remember the entire confrontation (the other two being [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[Silver Surfer]]) as he had briefly witnessed Warlock\'s soul during the fight.<ref>\'\'Infinity Gauntlet\'\' #1-6</ref>\n\nEric\'s role as Thor is relatively brief, as the Enchantress manipulates Eric into attacking Thor for Sif\'s affection. During a confrontation with Thor, Eric hits Sif, which provokes Thor, leading him to defeat Eric and reclaim Mjolnir while Odin reveals the Enchantress\'s manipulations.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #458</ref> Odin then creates a new mace for Eric called [[Thunderstrike (comics)#Item|Thunderstrike]].<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #459</ref>\n\nEric first uses the Thunderstrike mace against the villains [[Bloodaxe (comics)|Bloodaxe]] and Carjack and is promptly defeated. Afterwards, Eric creates his own costume to distinguish himself from Thor, while keeping Thor\'s reputation intact. Eric renames himself Thunderstrike, after the mace itself, operating as an adventurer and crimefighter.<ref>\'\'Thunderstrike\'\' #1</ref> Eventually Eric defeats Bloodaxe, only to discover that Bloodaxe was actually Jackie Lukus, his current love interest.<ref>\'\'Thunderstrike\'\' #22</ref>\n\nAfter a confrontation with [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]] the Egyptian god of death, Eric realizes the only way to defeat him is to succumb to the curse contained with the Bloodaxe and increase his strength.<ref>\'\'Thunderstrike\'\' #22-23</ref> After his supposed slaying of Seth, Eric is confronted by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], who attempt to arrest him for murder. Eric defeats the Avengers and is confronted by Thor. Eric pleads with Thor to kill him to prevent the curse of the Bloodaxe from taking him over completely. Eric is eventually forced to fight the Bloodaxe subconsciously, which manifests in Eric\'s mind in the form of [[Executioner (comics)|Skurge]]. Eric eventually defeats the Skurge duplicate, causing a psychic backlash that kills him and destroys the two weapons. Claiming that [[Valhalla]] is not where he belongs, Eric is sent into the afterlife by Odin.<ref>\'\'Thunderstrike\'\' #24</ref>\n\nEric is temporarily resurrected by the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] several years later, along with several other deceased Avengers. After overcoming the Grim Reaper\'s control, he and the other undead Avengers are returned to the afterlife by the [[Scarlet Witch]]. Before returning to the afterlife, Eric asks Thor to check in on his son for him.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' vol. 3 #11</ref>\n\nHis mace (revealed to have been repaired by Thor and left in custody of the Avengers) is eventually given by [[Captain America|Commander Steve Rogers]] to Kevin, who goes on to become the new Thunderstrike.<ref>\'\'Thunderstrike\'\' Vol 2 #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nEric\'s abilities are derived from the enchanted mace [[Thunderstrike (comics)#Item|Thunderstrike]], made of mystic uru metal, which is nearly indestructible, crafted by the Asgardian dwarves Brokk and Eitri, and given the following enchantments by Odin. Stamping the mace reverts Thunderstrike back to Eric\'s mortal human form, dressed in whichever clothes he last wore in that form, with any physical damage fully healed with the exception of certain mystical spells such as Seth\'s Mark of Death, while the mace Thunderstrike transforms into a wooden cane. By stamping his walking stick on the ground Eric Masterson transformed back into his superhuman form, bearded and dressed in the garb of Thunderstrike, while the cane again becomes the mace.\n\nThe mace itself can be thrown over great distances and return to the point it is thrown from. By throwing the mace and gripping the strap, Thunderstrike can fly (although the comic emphasizes that this is much rockier and less steady than Thor\'s flight). He can use the mace to fire powerful concussive blasts of mystical energy. The mace magically enables him to survive the adverse conditions of outer space, including its lack of oxygen. The mace can also be used for tracking various energy sources and has the ability to create mystical vortices to travel from one place to another.\n\nThunderstrike\'s physical abilities are enhanced to superhuman levels, including his strength, speed, durability, agility, reflexes, and endurance. As Thunderstrike, he was one of the strongest heroes in the Marvel Universe, though his strength did not approach the level of Thor. He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, and has received some combat training from Captain America and Hercules.\n\nAs Masterson, he is a highly skilled architect, with a master\'s degree in architecture. He is near-sighted and wears glasses.\n\n==In other media==\n===Video games===\n\n* Thunderstrike makes a cameo appearance as a non playable character with the rest of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] at the end of \'\'[[Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage]]\'\'.\n* Thunderstrike appears as a playable character in the [[arcade game|arcade]] [[fighting game]] \'\'[[Avengers in Galactic Storm]]\'\'.\n* Thunderstrike appears as a playable character in the 2015 game \'\'[[Lego Marvel\'s Avengers]]\'\'.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=10062|title=Eric Masterson}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvelwiki|Thunderstrike|Thunderstrike}}\n\n{{Thor}}\n\n[[Category:1993 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Ron Frenz]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Thor (Marvel Comics)]]'

Scott Washington first appeared in \'\'The New Warriors\'\' #21 (March 1992) by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and penciller [[Mark Bagley]]. The Hybrid symbiote first appeared in \'\'Venom: Along Came A Spider\'\' #1 (January 1996) by writer [[Evan Skolnick]] and penciller [[Patrick Zircher]].\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and penciller [[Mark Bagley]], Scott Washington appears in \'\'The New Warriors\'\' #21 (March 1992), #25-26 and #36. In 1996, he is the main character Hybrid in the back-up stories in two miniseries \'\'Venom: Along Came a Spider\'\' and  \'\'Venom: The Hunted\'\', all written by [[Evan Skolnick]].\n\nIn 2007, he is mentioned in \'\'Civil War: Battle Damage Report\'\' #1. Hybrid is also mentioned at the conclusion of the first issue of \'\'Carnage U.S.A.\'\' (2011), along with [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]], [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]], and Scorn, as being the next option to stop Carnage\'s rampage in the Mid-west after the Avengers are defeated.<ref>\'\'Carnage U.S.A.\'\' #1</ref><ref>[http://marvel.com/news/story/16101/carnage_usa. Carnage U.S.A.], [[Marvel.com]]</ref>\n\nHe has an entry in \'\'All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z\'\' #5 - \'Gorgon to Jury\' (2006) and an entry in \'\'Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z\'\' HC vol. 05 - \'Guardsmen to Jackal (Warren)\' (2008).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\nScott Washington was an [[African-American]] [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsman]] involved in guarding and transporting [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]] who had been arrested and sentenced to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] prison for [[supervillains]].<ref>\'\'New Warriors\'\' #21</ref>\n\nHybrid is an amalgamation of the [[Life Foundation]]\'s four symbiotes ([[Riot (comics)|Riot]], Lasher, Phage and Agony) into a single symbiote entity. The fused symbiote then sought out Washington in the Vault\'s lab facility. While guarding the symbiotes, Scott realized that they were not evil, not a threat, and the experiments were causing the organism terrible pain, so he let it go.<ref>[[Evan Skolnick]] (w), [[Patrick Zircher]] (p), Greg Adams (i), "First Touch", \'\'Venom: Along Came a Spider\'\' #1</ref> When his superiors discovered that Scott had released the aliens he was supposed to guard, Scott was fired. He returned to the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, the gang-torn neighborhood in which he grew up. Following a basketball court scuffle with the Eazy X [[gang]], Scott and his brother Derek were shot: Derek was killed while Scott became crippled, losing the use of his legs.<ref name=HFusion>[[Evan Skolnick]] (w), [[Patrick Zircher]] (p), Greg Adams (i), "Fusion", \'\'Venom: Along Came a Spider\'\' #2</ref>\n\nThe Hybrid symbiote afterwards located and bonded with Scott, which resulted in Scott regaining the ability to walk,<ref name=HFusion/> and more since Scott has a lot of anger, so often the symbiotes hold him back from acts of [[violence]], not the other way around. Since the Hybrid symbiote was originally four different entities, Scott has to contend with four different voices / personalities in his head besides his own. As Hybrid, Scott got revenge on the Eazy Xs gang that had crippled him.<ref>\'\'Venom: Along Came a Spider\'\' #3-4</ref> Hybrid began to get a lot of press attention. While most of Hybrid\'s publicity was positive, [[The Jury (comics)|The Jury]]\'s attention got drawn anyway. Despite Scott and [[Curtis Elkins]] (Sentry) being former co-workers, Hybrid would\'ve been executed by these self-appointed guardians of justice just for being a symbiote host but was rescued by the [[New Warriors]]. Justice offered membership in the group but Scott declined, citing more important work to do in his home neighborhood.<ref>\'\'Venom: The Hunted\'\' #1-3</ref>\n\nScott Washington was considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]], [[Ronald Byrd]] | Penciller = [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story = | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>\n\nHybrid is hunted down and murdered by [[Eddie Brock]] as part of a goal to eliminate the symbiotes\' "evil" from Earth.<ref>\'\'Venom (2011)\'\' #15</ref>\n\nThe Hybrid symbiote is later separated into the four symbiotes by a clandestine military group to be used by the U.S. Government,<ref>\'\'Carnage U.S.A.\'\' #2-5</ref> however, the separated symbiotes later use [[Deadpool]] as a host for a new version of Hybrid against [[Cletus Kasady]],<ref>\'\'Deadpool vs. Carnage\'\' #3</ref> followed by a military dog who is instructed to bring the symbiotes to "the governmental bigwigs who know how to take care of \'em".<ref>\'\'Deadpool vs. Carnage\'\' #4</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLike [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote, Hybrid has wall-crawling and web-slinging abilities, and can form pseudopodia or tendrils to create snares and bladed weapons. Hybrid also has the ability to camouflage, such as its ability to mimic clothes on the person it has bonded with. It also has a border-line warning sense and can "see" through symbiote itself. Hybrid can also detach a piece of itself to send messages to allies, and can change shape to form a membrane that allows it to glide through the air. The Hybrid symbiote can also absorb various materials and chemicals, such as Spider-Man\'s synthetic webbing.\n\nLike the Venom and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] symbiotes, the Hybrid symbiote has superhuman strength. With Scott Washington as its host, he regained his ability to walk which he had lost during a gang fight. After Washington\'s death and being forcibly separated, the symbiotes became catatonic and no longer retain sentience.{{issue|date=July 2016}}\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Video games===\n* Hybrid appears as a boss and later an unlockable character in the [[Facebook]] game \'\'[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]\'\'.<ref>"Avengers Alliance Guide".

The character was created by artist [[John Romita Jr.]] and writer [[Mark Millar]].  She is a young but effective [[vigilante]], trained by her father [[Damon McCready]] (a.k.a. Big Daddy) from an early age to be a [[real-life superhero|costumed superhero]] and [[assassin]].  In \'\'[[Kick-Ass (comic book)|Kick-Ass]]\'\', she is introduced as a [[supporting character]].  She featured in her own self-titled comic book series, \'\'[[Hit-Girl (comic book)|Hit-Girl]]\'\',  which was first published on 27 June 2012.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/171267-read-the-first-six-pages-to-hit-girl-1 | title=Read the First Six Pages of Hit-Girl #1 | first=Spencer | last=Perry | date=22 June 2012 | accessdate=23 June 2012 | publisher= SuperHeroHype.com}}</ref>  She is portrayed by [[Chlo\xc3\xab Grace Moretz]] who was fourteen at the time in the [[Kick-Ass (film series)|feature film adaptations]] \'\'[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]\'\' and \'\'[[Kick-Ass 2 (film)|Kick Ass 2]]\'\'.\n\n==Comics==\n===\'\'Kick Ass\'\'===\n{{main|Kick-Ass (comic book)}}\n\n===\'\'Hit-Girl\'\'===\n{{main|Hit-Girl (comic book)}}\nIn the \'\'Hit-Girl\'\' comic, Hit-Girl takes on Kick-Ass as her crime-fighting partner, training him and using him to hunt criminals together with her.

[[Jane Goldman]], one of the two co-writers of the first film\'s script, said, "We just really wanted Hit-Girl to be a character who, in a sense, simply happens to be an eleven-year-old girl, in the same way that [[Ellen Ripley|Ripley]] in \'\'[[Alien (film)|Alien]]\'\' could have been a guy but the part happened to be played by [[Sigourney Weaver]]." Goldman said that Mindy "is genuinely dangerous, she\'s genuinely mad. It\'s not her fault: she\'s been raised in this environment where she doesn\'t know anything different. She\'s unwittingly part of a [[folie a deux]]."<ref name="Goldmanmeet">{{cite news\n |date        = 21 March 2010\n |last        = Day\n |first       = Elizabeth\n |url         = http://m.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/mar/21/jane-goldman-screenwriter-kick-ass?cat=film&type=article\n |title       = Jane Goldman: Meet the screenwriter of the controversial new film Kick-Ass\n |location    = UK\n |work        = The Guardian\n |accessdate  = 23 January 2011\n |archivedate = 23 January 2011\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/5vxl7FUhR?url=http://m.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/mar/21/jane-goldman-screenwriter-kick-ass?cat=film&type=article\n |deadurl     = yes\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref> When asked if Hit-Girl could be considered a feminist heroine, Goldman said "Yeah... she\'s a feminist hero by token of the fact that she pays no attention to gender stereotypes.

Romita added "They become unconscious athletes, almost to a fault. They become hardened. It kind of works the same way. If you treat someone so intensely, ... why couldn\'t they?

He stated that, "If we make that, hopefully that will be the sorbet for the people that didn\'t like \'\'Kick-Ass 2\'\' and then we can go off and make \'\'Kick-Ass 3\'\'.

She has proven herself capable of defeating large groups of armed thugs wielding only a pair of swords or a double-bladed pole-arm. She is also an excellent marksman and proficient with practically all firearms from pistols to automatic rifles. Mindy has proven herself adept at stealth and evasion being able to infiltrate a maximum security prison with ease. She is also an expert driver with her vehicle of choice being a custom high-powered motorcycle. The nature of Big Daddy\'s training has made Hit-Girl a particularly brutal and remorseless character who does not flinch at torture or dispatching her opponents in the most gruesome and painful ways possible. In fact she can be so intimidating that when she was briefly imprisoned she was soon the undisputed ruler of the adult penitentiary where she was held despite being a twelve-year-old girl. Mindy\'s one weakness, as pointed out by Mother Russia, is that her strength is limited by her youth which can cause an over-reliance on her weapon\'s skills to compensate. Indeed, Mother Russia seemed to be more than a match for Hit-Girl at hand-to-hand combat with the young vigilante winning their fight mostly through the intervention of chance.\n\n==Personality==\nMindy has a very hardened, almost [[nihilism|nihilist]] personality, as she is desensitized to blood, violence, and death.  She curses regularly and makes crude jokes, often adopts a sarcastic demeanor towards her crime-fighting partner/apprentice [[Kick-Ass (character)|Kick-Ass]], who describes her as resembling a mix between [[John Rambo]] and [[Polly Pocket]].  Despite her emotionally hardened nature in costume, she has a very fun, warm and loving personality towards her father, Damon.  Mindy has an interest in [[Hello Kitty]], comic books, [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[John Woo]] movies.  Mindy is considerably more mature than her age would suggest, as she has proven herself to be more focused and level-headed than her counterpart Kick-Ass.  This is apparent in both the comic and film versions of the series.  For example, when Kick-Ass tells her that her father was just murdered, she responds by saying "Finish the job, mourn later."<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = Mark Millar| penciller = John Romita, Jr.| inker = Tom Palmer| colorist = Dean White| letterer = Chris Eliopoulos| editor = | story = | title = Kick-Ass| volume = | issue = | date = 2010| publisher = Marvel Pub.| location = New York, NY| page = chapter Seven| panel = 3| id ={{isbn|9780785134350}} }}</ref>  However, when the villain [[John Genovese|Johnny G]] is finally dead, she turns to Kick-Ass and asks him for a hug, covered in tears and blood.<ref>Kick-Ass, chapter Eight</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group="Note" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Comics|United States|United Kingdom|Fictional characters}}\n* [http://io9.com/5514828/hit+girl-responds-to-the-outrage-against-her-teenage-ultra+violence Hit-Girl Responds To The Outrage Against Her Teenage Ultra-Violence] at [[io9]]\n* [http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Getting-Away-With-Hit-Girl-How-Kick-Ass-Lets-You-Root-For-An-Adolescent-Killer-18122.html Getting Away With Hit Girl: How Kick-Ass Lets You Root For An Adolescent Killer] at Cinema Blend\n\n{{Kick-Ass}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita Jr.]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Millar]]\n[[Category:Child superheroes]]\n[[Category:Child characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Child characters in film]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2008]]\n[[Category:Comic book sidekicks]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Fictional knife-fighters]]\n[[Category:Fictional hybrid martial artists]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Image Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Kick-Ass]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]'

Created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Werner Roth (comics)|Werner Roth]], the character first appeared in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]\'\' #28 (January 1967).\n\nAn [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Banshee possesses a "sonic scream", capable of harming enemies\xe2\x80\x99 [[auditory system]]s and causing physical vibrations. He is named after the [[banshee]], a legendary ghost from Irish mythology, said to possess a powerful cry.\n\nA former Interpol agent and [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] [[police officer]], Banshee was always a decade older than most of the X-Men and had only a relatively short tenure as a full-time X-Man. He was a mentor of the 1990s-era junior team [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]. [[Caleb Landry Jones]] played the role of Banshee in 2011\'s \'\'[[X-Men: First Class]]\'\'.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\nBanshee was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Werner Roth (comics)|Werner Roth]], and first appeared in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]\'\' #28 (January 1967). When the character first appeared, he acted as an adversary to the X-Men under coercion, but soon befriended the team and eventually appeared as a member of the X-Men in \'\'[[Giant-Size X-Men]]\'\' #1 (May 1975). The character was forced to leave the team when his superpowers were damaged in battle in \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #119 (March 1979), and remained an occasional supporting character for the team for several years. Banshee eventually healed fully, and rejoined the team in \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #254 (Dec 1989) for a short stint, later becoming a central figure in the title \'\'[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]\'\', which lasted from 1994 to 2001. Banshee was killed in issue #2 of the 2006 \'\'[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]\'\' limited series.\n\nBanshee was one of the feature characters in the 2011 two-issue limited series \'\'Chaos War: X-Men\'\'.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nSean Cassidy is discovered by the villainous [[Kevin Sydney|Changeling]], who invites him to join [[Factor Three]]. Cassidy declines upon learning Factor Three\'s goals. Factor Three, along with the [[Ogre (Marvel Comics)|Ogre]], captures him and places a headband containing explosives around his head to force him to obey their commands. Codenamed after the [[banshee]], a spirit from [[Irish mythology]], Cassidy is forced to perform various criminal missions for Factor Three. On a mission in [[New York City]], Banshee encounters the X-Men. [[Professor X]] uses his [[telepathy]] to disarm the headband and remove it, allowing Banshee to help the X-Men defeat Factor Three.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 1 #28</ref>\n\nLater, Factor Three captures him again<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 1 #35</ref> but he helps the X-Men defeat Factor Three\'s ally, the [[Mutant Master]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 1 39</ref> The [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] capture him, but he is released from their captivity.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 1 #60</ref> While on the run from the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]], he fights [[Captain America]] and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], mistaking their then-fugitive status for a link to his pursuers.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #172</ref>\n\nBanshee joins the second group of X-Men.<ref>\'\'Giant-Size X-Men\'\' #1</ref> After a mission at [[Krakoa]], Banshee remains with the "New X-Men". Banshee accompanies the team on many different missions and is present for several key moments in the X-Men\'s history, including the first appearance of the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] and the team\'s first encounter with the [[Shi\'ar]]. While with the X-Men, he falls in love with Xavier\'s ex-girlfriend, Dr. [[Moira MacTaggert]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 1 #96</ref> Alongside the X-Men, he fights his cousin [[Black Tom Cassidy]] and the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 1 #101-103</ref> When Banshee loses the use of his powers due to damaged vocal cords,<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #119</ref> he leaves the X-Men to stay with MacTaggert.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #129</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Black Tom was secretly raising Banshee\'s daughter, Theresa.

Beast concludes that healing Banshee of the Death Seed energy that made him a Horseman of Death will take years and highly advanced technology.<ref>\'\'Uncanny Avengers\'\' #23</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBanshee is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] whose superhumanly powerful lungs, throat, and vocal cords could produce a sonic scream for various effects, in concert with limited, reflexive psionic powers which directed his sonic vibrations. He could hover or fly at the speed of sound, and could carry at least one passenger. He could overwhelm listeners with deafening noise, stun them with tight-focus low-frequency sonic blasts (effective even against shielded ears by penetrating the skull via bone conduction), plunge them into a hypnotic trance, disorient them, nauseate them, or simply render them unconscious. Using sonic waves, he could rapidly vibrate himself or other masses at will. He could generate sonic blasts which struck with tremendous concussive force, liquefying or outright disintegrating targets at his highest levels of power. By radiating sound waves outward and reading the feedback, he could locate and analyze unseen objects in a [[sonar]]-like fashion. By modulating his scream\'s harmonics, he could confuse most scanning equipment. He could instinctively analyze, replicate, and block sonic waves or vibrations from other sources.\n\nBanshee generated a psionic field which protected him from the detrimental effects of his sonic vibrations, though his sonic powers could still injure him when pushed beyond safe limits. For a while, his sonic powers were gone after having to use them up and down the harmonic scale to stop a weapon of [[Moses Magnum]]\'s. His physiology seemed fully vulnerable to conventional injury when his sonic powers were not engaged. Banshee had [[attention|selective hearing]], enabling him to focus upon, enhance, or totally block out any given sound in his environment; this shielded him from the deafening sound of his own screams, and made him a superhumanly acute eavesdropper in surveillance situations. Sean and his cousin Black Tom were immune to each other\'s natural mutant energy powers, though Sean\'s immunity did not extend to the new powers Tom later developed via artificial mutations.\n\nA gifted detective, veteran undercover operative, and formidable unarmed combatant, Cassidy was an excellent marksman and a competent amateur machine-smith, well-versed in combat strategy & tactics, and teamwork drills, from his training at Interpol. An effective educator, organizer, and lobbyist, he was also an avid American country music aficionado and skillful amateur piano player. As Cassidy, he wielded conventional firearms, sometimes loaded with explosive "micro-bombs." As Banshee, he wore synthetic costuming designed to resist air friction, usually including underarm wings that helped him glide on air currents and his own sonic waves. The "ribbons" on Banshee\'s costume (a visual trademark of the character) aid him in his flight.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Banshee had a close bond with [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]. Over the course of events in those comics, he fights the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horseman]] [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]] twice, the second time sacrificing his life to destroy the dangerous mutant.<ref>\'\'Amazing X-Men\'\' #3</ref>\n\n===Marvel Noir===\nIn \'\'[[X-Men Noir]]\'\', Sean Cassidy is depicted as a heroin dealer and an inmate at Welfare Pen and one of [[Angel (Timely Comics)|Angel]]\'s childhood acquaintances.<ref>\'\'X-Men Noir #3\'\'</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Banshee is the name of a drug similar to Mutant Growth Hormone. The drug was being made and distributed by [[Moira MacTaggert#Ultimate Moira MacTaggert|Moira MacTaggert]], who displayed the powers of [[Earth-616]]\'s Sean Cassidy.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #94</ref>\n\n===Renew Your Vows===\nBanshee is briefly seen escaping the Brotherhood of Mutants to warn the X-Men about Jubilee being a traitor but is confronted by Magneto and is crushed by a shipping container.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider Man: Renew Your Vows\'\' #6</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Banshee appeared in the \'\'[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men Animated Series]]\'\'. He fought Black Tom Cassidy in the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Saga]] and alongside the X-Men in the episode "[[List of X-Men episodes#Season Four|Proteus]]". His last appearance was in the episode "The Phalanx Covenant" Part 2 (Season 5, episode 2). During the series, he is shown to have a romantic relationship with [[Moira MacTaggert]].\n\n===Film===\n* Actor [[Jeremy Ratchford]] portrays the character in a 1996 [[live-action]] \'\'[[Generation X (film)|Generation X]]\'\' [[television movie]].{{cn|date=December 2016}} In the movie, Banshee runs [[X-Mansion|Xavier\'s School for Gifted Youngsters]] with [[Emma Frost]].

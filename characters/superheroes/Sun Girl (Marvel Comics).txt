She first appeared in \'\'Sun Girl\'\' #1 (Aug. 1948), published by Marvel\'s 1940s precursor, [[Timely Comics]]. Sun Girl starred in a namesake three-issue series cover-dated August to December 1948.

She additionally starred in a solo story each in the first two of those \'\'Marvel Mystery\'\' issues. The Human Torch-Sun Girl story "The Ray of Madness" from \'\'The Human Torch\'\' #33 (Nov. 1948) was reprinted decades later in Marvel\'s \'\'[[Avengers (comics)|Giant-Size Avengers]]\'\' #1 (Aug. 1974). Sun Girl appears in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] in the final two issues of the four-issue [[miniseries]] \'\'Saga of the Original Human Torch\'\' (April\xe2\x80\x93July 1990)\n\nA new Sun Girl debuted in \'\'[[Superior Spider-Man Team-Up]]\'\' #1 and will appear as one of the main characters in the upcoming [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch of the \'\'[[New Warriors]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/19233-nycc-exclusive-new-warriors-regroup-relaunch-in-2014.html|title=NYCC Exclusive: NEW WARRIORS Regroup, Relaunch in 2014|publisher=Newsarama|date=13 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Mary Mitchell===\nA personal secretary for [[Human Torch (android)|Jim Hammond]], the original Human Torch, during the post-war 1940s, Mary Mitchell falls in love with him and becomes his partner as well as his sidekick after [[Toro (comics)|Toro]] leaves to tend to his ailing foster mother.{{issue|date=December 2012}} In issue #32 (Sept. 1948), Sun Girl helps the Torch clear the name of an innocent man accused of murder charges, by exposing the real culprit. Later, they convince a retired doctor to perform surgery on a little girl who accidentally swallowed a diamond hidden in a lollypop. Mary leaves to go on her own adventures after that. She occasionally teams up with heroes besides the Torch, such as [[Captain America]]. After Toro returns she resumes her position as secretary and researcher.\n\nDuring the "Last Days" part of the \'\'[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\'\' storyline, Sun Girl was seen living at Valhalla Villas (a retirement home for ex-heroes and ex-villains that is located in Miami).

Sun Girl is attacked by [[The Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]\' mind in [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]\'s body). The Superior Spider-Man cures Sun Girl of the Carrion virus.<ref>\'\'Superior Spider-Man Team-Up\'\' #1.</ref> Her identity is later revealed to be Selah Burke, the daughter of [[Lightmaster]] at the time when the Superior Spider-Man made use of his Superior Six (consisting of a brainwashed [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Mysterio]], [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]) to combat the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]]. After the Superior Spider-Man fails and the now free Superior Six have captured him and taken hold of a machine that could destroy New York City, Selah manages to save Superior Spider-Man and destroy the machine. They part in bad terms, with Sun Girl thinking that Superior Spider-Man is a "jerk" due to his condescending attitude and insane brainwashing scheme.<ref>\'\'Superior Spider-Man Team Up\'\' #6.</ref>\n\nSelah next appeared in issue #1 of the 2014 \'\'[[New Warriors]]\'\' relaunch, helping to save the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] from an attack by the mysterious Evolutionaries.<ref>\'\'New Warriors\'\' #1.</ref> When offered the opportunity to walk away by these attackers (as they have no intention of going after normal humans), she opts to sacrifice so the mutants can run away. Haechi steps in and uses his energy absorbing powers to shield her. [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]] and [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]] enter the scene which makes the three attackers reevaluate their tactical position and later flee as they were now outnumbered.<ref>\'\'New Warriors\'\' #2.</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMary Mitchell is a good acrobat and is an expert in both Judo and Jiu Jutsu.

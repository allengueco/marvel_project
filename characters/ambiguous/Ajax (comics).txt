b'{{all plot|date=November 2014}}\n\'\'\'Ajax\'\'\' is the codename belonging to two different characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. One character is the descendant of a [[demigod]], the other a mercenary.\n\nThe mercenary Ajax is portrayed by [[Ed Skrein]] in the 2016 feature film \'\'[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]\'\'.\n\n==Pantheon character==\n{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Ajax\n|real_name=\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=\'\'[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]\'\' #379 (March 1991)\n|creators=[[Peter David]]<br>[[Dale Keown]]\n|alliances=[[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=* Accelerated healing factor\n* Extended lifespan\n\'\'\'Via exoskeleton battle-suit\'\'\':\n* Superhuman strength, durability and reflexes\n|}}\n\n===Publication history===\n{{expand section|date=November 2014}}\nAjax first appeared in \'\'[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]\'\' #379 (March 1991), and was created by writer [[Peter David]] and artist [[Dale Keown]].\n\n===Fictional character biography===\nAjax is a member of the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], and is one of the descendants of the immortal [[Agamemnon (comics)|Agamemnon]], along with Achilles, Atalanta, Cassiopeia, Delphi, Hector, Paris, Perseus, Prometheus, and Ulysses. Ajax was born in Texas. He was named after [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]], a Greek warrior who fought in the [[Trojan War]].{{issue|date=February 2016}}\n\nWhen the warriors of the Pantheon first encounter the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], for the purpose of inviting him to join them, Ajax attacks the Hulk after he believes the Hulk has struck Atalanta, for whom Ajax bears an unrequited crush. To prevent injuries to nearby civilians, Hulk pretends to be rendered unconscious so that the Pantheon will take him captive.<ref>[[David, Peter]] (w), [[Keown, Dale]] (w). \'\'[[Incredible Hulk]]\'\' #379.

Ajax fights rioters in New York City alongside Atalanta, killing some of them because his companion ordered this.<ref>David, Peter (w), Keown, Dale (w). \'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' #385.

He is eventually restrained and calmed by the Hulk.<ref>David, Peter (w), [[Frank, Gary]] (p), Smith, Cam (i). \'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' #405. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nAjax is so massive that he cannot move quickly without a special [[Powered exoskeleton|exoskeleton]] battle-suit, which grants him superhuman strength, durability and reflexes. His strength increases as his anger builds, much like that of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].  Like other members of the Pantheon, Ajax has a fast healing ability and an extended lifespan. Without support from his battle-suit, Ajax\'s legs and spine would collapse under his tremendous weight. His body is disproportionate in shape. He also has poor vision.\n\n===Personality===\nHe has the mentality of a young child, making him sometimes difficult to control. [[Atalanta (Pantheon)|Atalanta]] has always been able to calm him down, as he idolizes her and will do anything she says. Of course, this sometimes leads to other problems. For a time, he did not understand the difference between romantic love and platonic friendship love and this drove him into a rampage, where he even threatened Atalanta herself. The rampage was ended before anyone was seriously hurt (in Pantheon terms) or killed. Ajax took his rage out on an inanimate mountain, not realizing he was endangering himself as well. The Hulk managed to talk him into calming down.\n\nThe Hulk has also gotten into trouble when he fails to treat Ajax with the proper mind frame. At first he attacks Ajax again when he mistakes a simple hug for another threat against Atalanta. Then the Hulk let it slip that Bambi\'s mother had died, distressing Ajax who had been told, by Atalanta, she had run away and come back after the movie had ended.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Deadpool character==\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Ajax\n|real_name=Francis Fanny<ref name = "DVT">{{Cite comic|writer = Tim Seeley|penciller = Elmo Bondoc|inker = Elmo Bondoc|colorist = Ruth Redmond|letterer = VC\'s Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.

Francis acted as the strongarm for Killebrew, reining in the project\'s "washouts" that were fodder for Killebrew\'s sadistic experiments whenever they stepped out of line. This included Wade Wilson, who would later be known as the mercenary [[Deadpool]].<ref name="DeadpoolAnnual98">{{Cite comic\n| writer = [[Joe Kelly (writer)|Kelly, Joe]]\n| cowriters = Steve Harris, Reggie Jones, \'\'et al\'\'\n| story = A Kiss, A Curse, A Cure\n| title = 1998 Annual Starring Deadpool and Death\n| volume = 1\n| issue = \n| date = July 1998\n| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| location = [[New York, NY]]\n| page = \n| panel = \n| id = \n}}</ref>\n\nHaving had his nerves removed by Killebrew for better pain management, Francis would later have enhanced strength and intuitive capability, as well as receiving subcutaneous implants for super-speed and agility.<ref name="DeadpoolAnnual98" />\n\nAfter endless taunting from Wilson, Francis was given permission by Killebrew to kill him. Francis orchestrated events so that Wilson would perform a mercy killing on another inmate, which was against the rules; the inmate Deadpool was to kill was one to whom he had grown particularly close. After Francis removed Wilson\'s heart, his healing factor manifested itself for the first time by regenerating a new heart for the mercenary. However, the entire series of events cost him his sanity. Taking the codename Deadpool, he hunted down and seemingly killed Francis.<ref name="DeadpoolAnnual98" />\n\nRevealed to have survived, Francis resurfaced years later using the codename of Ajax. He hunted down and killed many of the surviving members of the Weapon X project to exact his revenge on Deadpool. Ajax tortured Killebrew at his mountain home in the Alps in order to obtain Wade\'s teleporter frequency; after which he teleported Wade next to a nearby cliff and sucker-punched him, sending Deadpool to his apparent death.<ref name="DeadpoolAnnual98" />\n\nIn a near death experience, however, it was revealed that because Wade came back from the dead once to kill Francis, he was now bound by honor and destiny to finish the job he began those many years ago, urged on by the ghosts of Francis\' victims who had also been Wilson\'s friends. The battle continued as Deadpool rescued Killebrew and sought shelter at Killebrew\'s neighbor\'s house. This was owned by Ilaney Bruckner who was reluctantly dragged into the conflict when Deadpool destroyed the house to slow down Francis.<ref name="DeadpoolV1Issue18">{{Cite comic\n| writer = [[Joe Kelly (writer)|Kelly, Joe]]\n| cowriters = [[Walter McDaniel]]\n| story = Payback Part One: Karmic Relief\n| title = Deadpool\n| volume = 1\n| issue = 18\n| date = July 1998\n| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| location = [[New York, NY]]\n| page = \n| panel = \n| id = \n}}</ref>\n\nFrancis caught up with the trio and proceeded to punch Deadpool repeatedly at super-speed.

He is annoyed by Wade\'s constant mocking, especially when Wade discovers his real name and claims he got the name Ajax from the [[Ajax (cleaning product)|cleaning product]]. His experiments result in Wade\'s hideous mutation and the destruction of the facility he worked in. He is injured by Wade (now known as "Deadpool") on a freeway, and escapes when his enemy is distracted by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]]. He and his partner [[Angel Dust (comics)|Angel Dust]] retaliate by kidnapping Wade\'s girlfriend [[Vanessa Carlysle|Vanessa]]. Deadpool and the two X-Men confront Ajax and his team at a scrapyard, where Ajax loses and is killed by Wade after he reveals that he cannot fix Wade\'s disfigurement.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvelwiki|Ajax_(disambiguation)|Ajax (disambiguation)}}\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Ajax_%28Pantheon%29_%28Earth-616%29 Ajax (Pantheon)] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Deadpool}}\n{{Weapon Plus}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ajax (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Joe Kelly]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Peter David]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1998]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

Apparently, he is immune to aging due to him eating a fruit from the Tree of Immortality.\n\nThe Tako Shamara version of the Dragon Lord could summon dragons and control them through elixirs created in his cauldron. He was mocked by Taskmaster for this flaw, who felt that such an ability would not be useful in combat due to its time-consuming nature.{{Issue|date=March 2010}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Dragon_Lord_(disambiguation) Dragon Lord (disambiguation)] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Lord Dragon Lord] at the Marvel Database Project\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/dragonlordsm.htm|Dragon Lord I}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=18153|title=Dragon Lord I}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/yutikunlunsonoftuan.htm|Dragon Lord (Nu-An)}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=13445|title=Dragon Lord (Nu-An)}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/draglrdj.htm|Dragon Lord (Tako Shamara)}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=16485|title=Dragon Lord (Tako Shamara)}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/dragonditko.htm|Dragon Lord (Ral Dorn)}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=33776|title=Dragon Lord (Ral Dorn)}}\n\n{{Steve Ditko}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Everett]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike Friedrich]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1972]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1980]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1981]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'

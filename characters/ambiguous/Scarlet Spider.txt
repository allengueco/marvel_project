It takes both Ben Reilly (as Spider-Man) and the [[New Warriors]] to stop the cybernetic Scarlet Spider, and the FBI put him in custody and have him undergo medical treatments to remove the technology.<ref>\'\'Web of Scarlet Spider\'\' #3</ref><ref>\'\'New Warriors\'\' #67</ref><ref>\'\'Web of Scarlet Spider\'\' #4</ref>\n\n==Scarlet Spiders (Red Team)==\n{{Main|Michael Van Patrick}}\nThe Scarlet Spiders, secretly all clones of a man named Michael Van Patrick, work with the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] and wear advanced versions of the [[Iron Spider]] armor.\n\n==Kaine Parker==\n{{Main|Kaine Parker}}\nKaine, a Spider-Man clone, adopts the Scarlet Spider alias for a time, starring in [[Scarlet Spider (comic book)#Volume 2|his own series]].\n\n==Other versions==\n===MC2===\n[[Image:FelicityScarlet.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Felicity Hardy makes her debut as Scarlet Spider.

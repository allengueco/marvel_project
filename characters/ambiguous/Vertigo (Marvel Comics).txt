The character is depicted as a native of the [[Savage Land]] who obtained superhuman powers at a young age by [[genetic engineering]]. Her powers enable her to render a person severely [[dizziness|dizzy]] and even [[unconsciousness|unconscious]].\n\n==Publication history==\nVertigo first appeared in \'\'[[Marvel Fanfare]]\'\' #1 (March [[1982 in comics|1982]]), created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Michael Golden (comics)|Michael Golden]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nShe was initially a member of the [[Savage Land Mutates]], empowered by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], with whom she first battled the [[X-Men]] and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>\'\'Marvel Fanfare\'\' #1</ref>\n\n===Marauders===\nLater, although not a mutant, she joined the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], a group of mutants working as assassins for the enigmatic [[geneticist]] known as [[Mister Sinister]].<ref>revealed in \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #211</ref> Sinister wanted his assassins to destroy a large community of mutants, known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], who lived under [[New York City]], as he had deemed them genetically useless. The Marauders did succeed in annihilating a large number of the underground mutants. While the Marauders were accomplishing this, they also clashed with the X-Men,<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #210\xe2\x80\x93213 (Oct. 1986\xe2\x80\x93Jan. 1987)</ref> [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]],<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' #10 (Nov. 1986)</ref> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #374 (Dec. 1986)</ref> and [[Power Pack]].<ref>\'\'Power Pack\'\' #27 (Dec. 1986)</ref> With the Marauders, she also attempted to kill [[Madelyne Pryor]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #221 (Sept. 1987)</ref>\n\nSinister later sent Vertigo along with the other Marauders to fight the X-Men in New York City just before the extra-dimensional incursion known as the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]".<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #240 (Jan. 1989)</ref> She was apparently killed in battle with the X-Men.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #241 (Feb. 1989)</ref> Her alliance with Sinister was short-lived at that time, as she soon rejoined her Savage Land Mutate allies.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nSaid allies join with the more peaceful of the Land\'s inhabitants to resist a territorial grab by humanoid saurians. Her powers are central in defeating the enemy army. Various X-Men broker a peace agreement leaving the Mutates to their own devices again.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #457-459 (May\xe2\x80\x93July 2005)</ref>\n\nVertigo and [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] encountered the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] in the Savage Land.

This power induces effects ranging from mild disorientation and vertigo to unconsciousness. Vertigo can focus her power on one or more individuals, or project it outward from herself in all directions, affecting everyone within her range of influence.\n\nVertigo is not immune to her own powers, as she was thrown off balance when [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] reflected her psychic waves back at her with [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]].\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of X===\nIn the \'\'[[Age of X]]\'\' reality Vertigo appeared as an X-Man.<ref>\'\'X-Men Legacy\'\' #245</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Vertigo also appeared in \'\'[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]\'\' voiced by Megan Smith.

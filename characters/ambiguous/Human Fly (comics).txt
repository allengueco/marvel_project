Stumbling into the laboratory of Dr. Harlan Stillwell (whose brother [[Farley Stillwell]] created the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] for [[J. Jonah Jameson]]), Deacon coerces the scientist into saving his life. Overhearing an offer Jameson made with Stillwell to fund the creation of a new superhero, Deacon insists he be the subject of the experiment. Stillwell imprints the genetic coding of a [[housefly]] onto Deacon, empowering him and healing him of his bullet wounds. Deacon then kills Harlan Stillwell after he served his purpose and uses his newfound powers to further his criminal ambitions. He first uses Jameson as bait to get revenge on Spider-Man. Due to his inexperience, the Fly is no match for him and is defeated.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man Annual\'\' #10</ref>\n\nSome time later, the Fly begins to display fly-like tendencies like eating garbage.<ref name="SpecSp86">\'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #86</ref> He also develops physical mutations, including [[facet eyes]].<ref name="SW30">\'\'Spider-Woman\'\' #30</ref> The Fly attacks Spider-Man after [[Spencer Smythe]] handcuffed him\xe2\x80\x94along with Jameson\xe2\x80\x94to a bomb. The Fly hurls the two from a rooftop and leaves them for dead. Once freed from the shackle, Spider-Man tries to stop the Fly from stealing an art exhibit, but the villain knocks him down and escapes. Soon afterwards, the police catch the Fly using [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] equipment.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #192\xe2\x80\x93193</ref>\n\nTraveling to [[Los Angeles]], the Fly seeks out Dr. [[Karl Malus]], who confirms that his powers are fading and he will soon be powerless. Malus recommends that he get a new set of powers using a blood transfusion from another superbeing, which would most conveniently be the locally operating [[Jessica Drew|Spider-Woman]]. With his powers already at less than a third their usual strength, however, he is unable to defeat her and is apprehended. Afterwards, Malus uses some of the Fly\'s DNA to temporarily mutate Scotty McDowell into the similarly powered [[Hornet (comics)#Hornet (Scotty McDowell)|Hornet]].<ref name="SW30"/>\n\nThe Fly is freed from prison and his powers restored by untold means. He subsequently battles [[Moon Knight]], leaving the hero temporarily paralyzed, and again seeks revenge against Jameson and Spider-Man.<ref>\'\'Moon Knight\'\' #35</ref> Partnered with the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], Spider-Man once more defeats the Fly.<ref name="SpecSp86" />\n\nOver time, Deacon\'s mutation increases. After escaping from a mental institution, Deacon is killed by a [[Scourge of the Underworld]] (who was disguised as a sanitation worker) while trying to take revenge on Spider-Man.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #276</ref>\n\nThe Human Fly is among the eighteen criminals that were murdered by Scourge of the Underworld to be resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>\'\'Punisher\'\' (vol. 7) #5</ref> He now has acidic vomit that can melt steel and wings strong enough to deflect cannon fire and sharp enough to cut a dump truck in two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/preview2.php?image=previews/marvelcomics/punisher/villains/PunisherVillains-7.jpg |title=Comic Book Resources |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2014-06-11 |accessdate=2015-07-23}}</ref> The Fly, now craving human flesh, devours a prostitute in a private room, and then fights a group of armed guards who burst in, vomiting deadly acid on them.

After a long hospitalization, including a number of reconstructive surgeries in which much of his skeleton was replaced by steel, he took on the masked identity of the Human Fly. As the Human Fly, he performed daredevil stunts to benefit various charities, especially those helping children with disabilities.\n\nHis activities often drew him into conflict with criminals, who were often seeking to rob the charity events at which he performed. Additionally, he drew the attention of [[Spider-Man]], who thought he might be the villain of the same name.\n\nThe character was based on real-life [[stunt performer|stuntman]] [[Rick Rojatt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-rocketman.com/human-fly.html |title=The Rocketman Online Store |publisher=The-rocketman.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}</ref> The comic book carried the tag line "The Wildest Super-Hero Ever&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Because He\'s Real!", and photographs of someone in a Human Fly costume appeared in the books. [[Jim Shooter]], a high-ranking member of Marvel\'s editorial staff at the time of publication, said in 2007 that the photos were indeed of Rojatt.<ref>Shooter, Jim. \'\'Back Issue\'\' #20 (Jan. 2007).</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Richard Deacon version of Human Fly has the abilities of flight, wall-crawling, and superhuman strength and agility. He also has compound eyes. Following his revival at the hands of Hood, Human Fly now has acid vomit that can melt steel and wings that are strong enough to deflect cannon fire and sharp enough to cut a dump truck in two. The wings soon regenerate if they are torn off.\n\nThe superhero version of Human Fly had 60% of his bone structure replaced by steel, which allows him to withstand any injury that normal humans cannot endure. He is also a master aerialist, stuntman, hand-to-hand combatant and gymnast, and uses specialized gadgets that help him in his performances, depending on the stunt.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* In the \'\'[[Spider-Woman (TV series)|Spider-Woman]]\'\' episode "Spider-Woman and the Fly", a crazed scientist named Dr. Hagel became a giant fly. The Fly was able to find out [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]\'s alter-ego. However, when he was turned back to normal, he forgot everything about Spider-Woman\'s true identity.\n* The super-villain Human Fly made a cameo appearance on the \'\'[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]\'\' episode "Attack of the Arachnoid". He was seen as an inmate in Ryker\'s Island with [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], and [[Blastaar]].\n\n===Film===\n* An [[independent film]] based on the superhero Human Fly is in development.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patten |first=Dominic |url=http://deadline.com/2012/06/human-fly-superhero-movie-in-development-292695/ |title=Human Fly\' Superhero Movie In Development |publisher=Deadline |date=2012-06-27 |accessdate=2018-05-01}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/flyrickd.htm|The Fly (Deacon)}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080720083508/http://ape-law.com/GAF/2007/10/classic-gone-and-forgotten-human-fly.html A satirical discussion of Marvel\'s series on the Human Fly/Rick Rojatt]\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Spider-Man}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Mantlo]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gil Kane]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Len Wein]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Fictional cannibals]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Fictional stunt performers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics titles]]'

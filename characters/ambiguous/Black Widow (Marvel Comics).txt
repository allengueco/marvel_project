b'{{Citation style|date=June 2012}}\n\'\'\'Black Widow\'\'\' is the name of several [[fictional]] characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Most of these versions exist in Marvel\'s main [[shared universe]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]].\n\n==Claire Voyant==\n{{main|Black Widow (Claire Voyant)}}\n\'\'\'Claire Voyant\'\'\' is the first costumed, superpowered female protagonist in comic books. Created by writer [[George Kapitan]] and artist [[Harry Sahle]], she first appeared in \'\'[[Mystic Comics]]\'\' #4 (Aug. 1940). She kills evildoers to deliver their souls to [[Satan]], her master. The character is unrelated to the later Marvel Comics superheroines who took on the codename.\n\n==Natalia Romanova / Natasha Romanoff==\n{{main|Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)}}\n\n\'\'\'Natalia "Natasha" Alianovna Romanova / Natasha Romanoff\'\'\'<ref>\'\'[[Wolverine: Origins]]\'\' #16 (Sep. 2007)</ref> is the first character to take on the Black Widow codename in the modern mainstream Marvel Comics. She was created by editor and plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Don Rico]] and artist [[Don Heck]], and first appeared in \'\'[[Tales of Suspense]]\'\' #52 (April 1964). The character has been associated with several superhero teams in the Marvel Universe, including the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. She has appeared in many other forms of media, including the major motion pictures \'\'[[Iron Man 2]]\'\', \'\'[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]\'\', \'\'[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]\'\', \'\'[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]\'\', \'\'[[Captain America: Civil War]]\'\', \'\'[[Avengers: Infinity War]]\'\' and \'\'[[Untitled Avengers film|Avengers 4]]\'\', wherein she is portrayed by actress [[Scarlett Johansson]].\n\n==Yelena Belova==\n{{main|Black Widow (Yelena Belova)}}\n\n\'\'\'Yelena Belova\'\'\' is the second character to take on the Black Widow codename in the modern mainstream comics who debuted briefly in \'\'[[Inhumans]]\'\' #5 (March 1999) and was fully introduced in the 1999 [[Marvel Knights]] mini-series \'\'Black Widow\'\'. A second miniseries, also titled \'\'Black Widow\'\' and featuring Natasha Romanoff and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], followed in 2001. The next year, she did a solo turn in her own three-issue miniseries titled \'\'Black Widow: Pale Little Spider\'\' under the mature-audience [[Marvel MAX]] imprint.

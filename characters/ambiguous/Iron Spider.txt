[http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/01/12/spideys-new-costume-revealed "Spidey\'s New Costume Revealed"]. [[IGN]].</ref>\n\nPeter Parker wore this suit as Spider-Man\'s official costume until writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] chose to revert to the older costume. It was used symbolically to show the character\'s divided loyalties during the 2006 - 2007 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline.\n\n==Known wearers==\n===Peter Parker===\n{{expand section|date=July 2016}}\nAfter [[Spider-Man]]\'s newer powers developed in "[[Spider-Man: The Other|The Other]]", [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] developed a new suit for Peter Parker which he nicknamed the "Iron Spider" costume.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #529</ref>\n\n===Scarlet Spiders===\nThe Iron Spider armor costume has been duplicated and used by [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP\'s]] three genetic clones in the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] who identify themselves as Red Team and also labeled the [[Scarlet Spider|Scarlet Spiders]]. It is unknown what new powers the team possesses, but they have been shown to be using some of the built-in powers such as the cloaking device, communications, and [[waldoes]] which the original costume possessed.<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #3</ref> One change is that there are now four waldoes, as opposed to three. These suits have the original\'s morphing ability,<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> as well as web-shooters, and wall-crawling capability.<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative Annual\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Mary Jane Watson===\n[[Mary Jane Watson]] later donned the Iron Spider armor in order to help Spider-Man and Iron Man fight [[List of Marvel Comics characters: R#Regent|Regent]]. She uses her experience in Iron Man\'s suit and her brief spider powers that she had back in the \'\'[[Spider-Island]]\'\' storyline to operate the armor.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' Vol. 4 #15</ref>\n\n===Aaron Davis===\n[[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]]\' uncle [[Prowler (comics)#Aaron Davis|Aaron Davis]] purchases a recolored and modified version of the Iron Spider armor which he uses to form his incarnation of the [[Sinister Six]].<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w), [[Bazaldua]] (a). \'\'Spider-Man\'\' #234 (January 2018). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nSupported by a system similar to that of Tony Stark\'s classic [[Iron Man]] design, The Iron Spider armor features many gadgets, including four mechanical spider-arms, or "[[Remote manipulator|waldoes]]", that can be used to see around corners (via cameras in the tips) and to manipulate objects indirectly. Stark describes them as too delicate to use in combat, yet Spider-Man shortly afterward uses them to smash through the sensors in [[Titanium Man]]\'s helmet. Later on during the "Civil War" storyline, he uses them (reluctantly) during his fight with [[Captain America]].\n\nOther features include short-distance gliding capability, limited bulletproofing, built-in [[fire department|fire]]/[[police]]/emergency scanner, audio/visual amplification (including [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]]), [[stealth technology|cloaking]] device, carbon filters to keep out airborne [[toxin]]s, and a short-range [[GPS]] microwave communication system. It grants the ability to breathe under water, and can morph into different shapes due to its "\'smart\' liquid metal" form. It can also "more or less disappear" when not needed due to reactions to neurological impulses as Tony Stark revealed. The new costume is able to look like other styles of costumes Spider-Man has worn over the years or turn into his street clothes. Part of the costume can detach itself from Spider-Man to cover an object too dangerous to touch, such as a radioactive asteroid. All these features are controlled by a computer system in the chest piece. The suit responds to mental control.<ref>\'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' #530. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Iron Spider armor also has a secret override that can be activated by Iron Man in case of emergencies or if Spider-Man ever switches sides (which he does in \'\'Civil War\'\' #5). However, unknown to Stark, Peter was already aware of the safety measure and had bypassed it with his own override, Password Surprise. Perhaps most sinister, Stark discovered a way to give his own Iron Man armor a "spider-sense" based on Peter\'s, and the ability to give Spider-Man\'s sense [[Red herring (plot device)|red herrings]].\n\n==Other versions==\n===Contest of Champions===\nIn the pages of \'\'Contest of Champions\'\', a variation of [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanov]] donned the Iron Spider identity in an unidentified alternate reality where Iron Man used the Reality Gem to rig the \'\'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\'\' in his favor where he later became President of the United States. She inherited it after Peter defected to Captain America\'s side and later became a member of the Civil Warriors.<ref>\'\'Contest of Champions (2015)\'\' #9-10</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n*The Iron Spider armor appears in the \'\'[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]\'\' animated series. It is initially used by Peter Parker in the episodes "Flight of the Iron Spider", "The Iron Octopus" and "Venom Bomb". Subsequent seasons depict the armor in the hands of [[Amadeus Cho]] under the Iron Spider mantle. Additionally the episode "Rampaging Rhino" features a variant Iron Spider Hulkbuster created by [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]] at the time when the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] fights with the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]].\n* Amadeus Cho\'s Iron Spider appearance appeared in \'\'[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes: Avengers Reassembled]]\'\'.\n\n===Film===\nThe Iron Spider is featured in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as an armored suit designed by Tony Stark for Peter Parker. Unlike the comic book version, this version\'s design is based on [[Ben Reilly]]\'s Spider-Man costume design.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n* The armor makes its first appearance in \'\'[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]\'\' (2017). At the end of the film, Stark unveils the Iron Spider suit and offers him membership in the Avengers, but Peter declines both.\n* The Iron Spider returns in \'\'[[Avengers: Infinity War]]\'\' (2018), with Peter now wearing the armor to aid the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] against [[Thanos]]. However, when Peter is erased from existence by [[Thanos]]\' Infinity Gauntlet, the suit fades with him. The suit uses [[nanotechnology]] and allows Peter to survive at high altitude and on Titan which  has low gravity levels and has a set of four \'waldoes\', which Spider-Man uses in combat and enhances his mobility and agility.\n\n===Video games===\n* The Wii version of \'\'[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]\'\' features the Iron Spider outfit as an unlockable costume.\n* The video game \'\'[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance]]\'\' features this costume as one of Peter Parker\'s three alternate costumes, other two alternates being a [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|black symbiote]] suit and the [[Ben Reilly|classic version]] of Scarlet Spider.\n* The video game \'\'[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2]]\'\' features this costume as Peter Parker\'s only alternate costume. This time, it includes the waldoes and the gold parts are now white. This costume can only be unlocked by choosing Pro-Registration.\n* The video games \'\'[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]\'\' and \'\'[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]\'\' also features the Iron Spider armor as an alternate suit for [[Spider-Man 2099]].\n* The Iron Spider armor appears as one of Spider-Man\'s alternate costumes in \'\'[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]\'\'.\n* The video game \'\'[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]\'\' features the Iron Spider costume as Spider-Man\'s final costume. However, it does not feature the waldoes.\n* The Iron Spider suit is referenced in \'\'[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]\'\' during a conversation between Spider-Man and Iron Man. During their infiltration in a [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] submarine, Iron Man says "You know, I could fit you with a rocket-propelled iron suit if you\'d like." and Spider-Man replies "sounds heavy."\n* Amadeus Cho\'s Iron Spider form appears in \'\'[[Lego Marvel\'s Avengers]]\'\', as DLC.\n* Mary Jane Watson\'s Iron Spider form appears in \'\'[[Marvel Avengers Academy]]\'\'.\n* The Iron Spider appears as one of Spider-Man\'s alternate costumes in \'\'[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite]]\'\' if Spider-Man\'s wearing the Superior Spider-Man outfit.\n* The MCU-Iron Spider appears as one of Spider-Man\'s alternate costumes as an unlockable and pre-order bonus in the 2018 \'\'[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]\'\' video game.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Iron_Spider_Armor Iron Spider Armor] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Spider-Man}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man]]\n[[Category:Fictional armour]]'

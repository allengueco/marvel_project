They are usually depicted as [[supervillain]]s and enemies of [[Spider-Man]].\n\n==Description==\nThey all started with the [[Green Goblin]] ([[Norman Osborn]]). They are usually people in a goblin costume terrorizing [[New York City]] with pumpkin bombs and a glider or have been transformed by using the Goblin Formula developed by Osborn and his former professor and business partner [[Mendel Stromm]].\n\n==Known Goblins==\n\n===Proto-Goblin===\nIn a retcon, it was revealed that after Norman Osborn had Mendel Stromm arrested for embezzlement. He had found only a portion of the notes detailing his partner\'s serum. Norman tests the incomplete version of the serum on Oscorp employee \'\'\'Nels Van Adder\'\'\', driving Van Adder insane and causing him to transform into a red, demon-like being known as the "\'\'\'Proto-Goblin\'\'\'". Killing several people and blaming Norman for his condition, Adder harasses and later attempts to kill him before being knocked out an Oscorp window by Chief of Security Arthur Stacy and his brother Detective [[George Stacy]]. In order to escape conviction for what he had done to Van Adder, Norman convinces the police that Van Adder had been experimenting on himself and that he had been trying to help him. Van Adder was last seen fleeing into the wilderness and his current fate is unknown.<ref>\'\'Peter Parker: Spider-Man\'\' #-1</ref> As well as endowing Adder with super strength and agility, the prototypical Goblin Serum gave him claws, talons, fangs, glowing green eyes, and near impenetrable red skin that is capable of withstanding several close range bullet shots.\n\n===Green Goblin===\n{{Main|Green Goblin}}\n\n===Hobgoblin===\n{{main|Hobgoblin (comics)}}\n\n===Demogoblin===\n{{main|Demogoblin}}\n\n===Grey Goblin===\nThe \'\'\'Grey Goblin\'\'\' is the alias of two [[fictional character]]s that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] that are enemies of [[Spider-Man]].

After being passed over for a promotion, an irritated Lowell showed Osborn his work, and Osborn, noticing Lowell\'s chemical was uncannily similar to the Goblin Formula, immediately fired him and ordered all his work terminated. As his life\'s work was being destroyed by Oscorp employees, an enraged Lowell tried to fight them off, only to become drenched in his formula, and knocked into a wall of solar lamps. The combination of the Goblin Serum-esque chemical and the electricity caused Lowell to mutate into a light-based being dubbed "\'\'\'Sundown\'\'\'". After going on a rampage through New York, Sundown was defeated and imprisoned by Spider-Man and several other heroes. After being incarcerated for ten years, Sundown was released from prison, but was blackmailed back into supervillainy shortly afterward by mob boss Lucky Lobo. Eventually turning against Lobo, Sundown, with Spider-Man\'s help, was able to expose his crimes. Afterward, Sundown declined Spider-Man\'s offer of becoming a superhero in favor of a normal life.<ref>\'\'Untold Tales of Spider-Man\'\' 1997 Annual</ref>\n\n==Goblins (species)==\n===Goblins of Asgard===\nThe \'\'\'Goblins of Asgard\'\'\' are one of the archetype of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]\'s Ten Realms alongside the [[Angels (Marvel Comics)|Angels]], Asgardian Gods, [[Dwarves (Marvel Comics)|Dwarves]], [[Elves (Marvel Comics)|Elves]], [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Giants]], and Men.<ref>\'\'Mighty Thor\'\' Vol. 2 #23</ref>\n\n===Goblins of Weirdworld===\nA race of Goblins reside in [[Weirdworld]] and are known to devour the flesh of Dwarves, Elves, [[Gnome]]s, and other humanoid creatures.

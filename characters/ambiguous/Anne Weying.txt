She is the first character who goes by the \'\'\'She-Venom\'\'\' identity before [[Patricia Robertson (comics)|Patricia Robertson]].\n\n[[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] portrays the character in the 2018 film \'\'[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]\'\'.\n\n==Publication history==\nAnne Weying first appeared in \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' #375 (March [[1993 in comics|1993]]), and was created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Mark Bagley]].\n\nShe-Venom first made a cameo appearance in \'\'[[Venom: Sinner Takes All]]\'\' #2 (September [[1995 in comics|1995]]) and her first full appearance was in \'\'Venom: Sinner Takes All\'\' #3 (October 1995), and was created by writer [[Larry Hama]] and artist Greg Luzniak.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nIn Ann Weying\'s first appearance, she is a brunette with glasses. In later appearances, she loses the glasses and goes blonde. \n\nAnn was a successful [[lawyer]], and [[Eddie Brock]]\'s ex-wife. Weying assisted [[Spider-Man]] by sharing some of Eddie\'s history. Later, she followed Spider-Man to the amusement park where Venom had Peter Parker\'s (fake) parents. She confronted her insane ex-husband, and managed to convince Eddie to give up this [[Feud|vendetta]]. Later, [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] shot Ann who became She-Venom when the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote temporarily bonded with her to save her life.<ref>\'\'Venom: Sinner Takes All\'\' #2</ref> She-Venom then lashed out against the men who had hurt her with such [[violence]] that Eddie became afraid for her (and of her) and compelled the symbiote back. Ann retched upon seeing the pile of bodies she had left behind. She claimed that the symbiote made her kill, but Eddie told her that the symbiote wouldn\'t force its host to do something they did not want to.<ref>\'\'Venom: Sinner Takes All\'\' #3</ref> Later, the police incarcerated Ann on a false charge (unrelated to Ann\'s rampage above) in order to trap Venom. Ann used her one phone call to warn Eddie and to promise not to come. Eddie promised that himself (Eddie) wouldn\'t come to save her and instead sent the "Other" (the symbiote) through the phone lines to her.<ref>\'\'Venom: Along Came A Spider\'\' #2</ref> After it bonded with her, She-Venom was able to break herself out of prison, heading to the amusement park where she and Spider-Man had confronted Venom, only to intercept a raid on a gang of drug dealers.<ref>\'\'Venom: Along Came A Spider\'\' #3</ref> During the fight, Eddie was badly injured by a flamethrower, prompting Anne to release the symbiote to heal, but left Eddie in disgust at dependence on the symbiote.<ref>\'\'Venom: Along Came A Spider\'\' #4</ref> \n\nWeying committed [[suicide]] after spotting Spider-Man webslinging in an older black costume at a time when the regular red and blue suit had been stolen. Ann, still reeling from the experience of bonding with the symbiote months earlier and unable to deal with Eddie\'s return into her life\xe2\x80\x94coupled with Brock\'s transformation directly in front of her as Venom ran off to kill Spider-Man\xe2\x80\x94sent her over the edge, and she leapt from her high rise apartment to her death.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' vol. 2 #19</ref> Her death is later confirmed when her tombstone is shown.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #22 (October 2000)</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Marvel 1602===\nDuring the \'\'[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\'\' storyline taking place in King James\' England (which is based off the \'\'[[Marvel 1602]]\'\' reality), Anne Weying is a "village beauty" who is brainwashed by printer\'s apprentice Edwin Brocc into loving with powers and potions supplied by the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]].

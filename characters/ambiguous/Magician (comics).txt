The last name Guardineer is a reference to the Golden Age comics creator [[Fred Guardineer]] who created Zatara, Tor and Merlin the Magnificent who were all magician crimefighters.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Lee Guardineer===\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Magician\n|real_name=Lee Guardineer\n|species=[[Human]]\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=\'\'[[Tales to Astonish]]\'\' #56 (June 1964) \n|creators=[[Stan Lee]]<br>[[Dick Ayers]]\n|alliances=\n|aliases=\n|powers=Skilled stage magician, trickster and illusionist<br>Master pickpocket<br>Expert animal trainer<br>Hypnosis<br>Use of motorized cane   \n|}}\n\nLee Guardineer is a [[Magic (illusion)|stage magician]] who used his stage acts to rob rich party guests. His activities attracted the attention of Giant-Man\'s ants who reported this. The Magician then robbed a yacht party run by the rich socialite Sterling Stuyvesant and kidnapped the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] to make Giant-Man jealous. In response, Giant-Man set up a phony [[yacht]] party which lured the Magician to a trap. Once that trap was sprung, Giant-Man captured the Magician and saved the Wasp. The Magician was fished out of the water by the police and later taken to prison.<ref>\'\'Tales to Astonish\'\' #56</ref> While [[Hank Pym]] was out of town, the Magician escaped from prison and set up a clothing store with Wasp-inspired clothing. When the Wasp arrived, the Magician attacks in order to capture the Wasp. However, the Wasp soon makes short work of the Magician using quick thinking and the store\'s many toys to take down the Magician who is promptly arrested by the police.<ref>\'\'Tales to Astonish\'\' #58</ref> \n{{-}}\n\n===Second version===\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Magician\n|real_name=\n|species=[[Human]]\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=\'\'Astonishing Ant-Man\'\' #2 (January 2016) \n|creators=[[Nick Spencer]]<br>[[Ramon Rosanas]]\n|alliances=\n|aliases=\n|powers=Skilled stage magician, trickster and illusionist\n|}}\nLee Guardineer had a son who took up the Magician mantle as part of the \'\'[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]\'\' event. Upon taking his father\'s mantle, Magician joined the [[Power Broker]]\'s Hench App (a mobile app that enabled people to solicit the service of supervillains). His first job has him hired by publicist Marlena Howard to pretend to have a grudge against Darla Deering (Miss Thing) for not hiring him for the opening act of the woman\'s show. The Magician interrupted Deering in the middle of her break-up fight against [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] and confronted the two heroes with genetically-modified rabbits and pigeons. After explaining his origin to Ant-Man, the Magician intentionally lost to Miss Thing. The fight between the Magician and Ant-Man and Darla was staged and filmed because it would make a successful pilot episode for Darla\'s newest reality show.<ref>\'\'Astonishing Ant-Man\'\' #2</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Lee Guardineer version of Magician is a skilled stage magician, trickster, and illusionist where his tricks rely on his technology. Besides being a master pickpocket, he is an expert animal trainer and can hypnotize anyone at will. The Magician has a motorized cane with a hatch on top that can act as a vacuum and be used as a divining rod to seek out his enemies.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Marvel===\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=[[File:XMEN Magician.jpg]]\n|caption=Magician (Elliot Boggs) in \'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #70.<br>Art by Ben Oliver.\n|character_name=Magician\n|real_name=Elliot Boggs\n|species=[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Human Mutant]]\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=\'\'[[Ultimate X-Men]] #66\'\' (March 2006)\n|creators=[[Robert Kirkman]] & [[Tom Raney]]\n|alliances=[[Ultimate X-Men]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=Reality Warping\n}}\n\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Magician is \'\'\'Elliot Boggs\'\'\'. His powers first emerged uncontrollably, apparently killing both of his parents. After being subdued by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], custody of him is given over to [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] in the hopes Elliot can control his powers. When Elliot awakes, he quickly urges [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] to let him join the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]]. Shorthanded, Cyclops allows Elliot to help the X-Men take on the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy]] attacking the \'Academy of Tomorrow. During the battle, Elliot manages to easily defeat the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]]. Afterwards, he adopts the Magician code name, which is suggested by television reporters. Several of the X-Men observe that the reporters got there amazingly fast, as well as the fact that the Brotherhood had no reason for the initial attack in the first place. After Elliot\'s interview, the X-Men are on good terms with the press for the first time since [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] [[Ultimate War|returned after an presumed death]].<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #71</ref>\n\nLater during an attack by the [[Friends of Humanity]] on a hospital that gave treatments to mutants (despite there being no mutant patients at the time and in broad daylight), Elliot once again fights alongside the X-Men. It turns out the group\'s leader is actually a mutant incapacitating the rest of the X-Men leaving only Elliot standing. The young mutant single-handedly defeats the mutant leader.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #72</ref>\n\nBefore the X-Men returned to the mansion, [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] paid Xavier a visit, requesting that Elliot join the [[Ultimates]]. However, Xavier refuses to which Fury says Elliot\'s parents have agreed to their son joining the Ultimates. Xavier is shocked to hear about the boy\'s parents, as Xavier was told that Elliot had killed his parents. When Fury is unable to recall saying or doing this and only heard of Elliot when he started appearing with the X-Men, Charles realizes something is very wrong.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #72</ref>\n\nCharles and Nick believe that Elliot has been messing with their minds, creating the illusion of Nick bringing him to Charles. Fury states that even if Elliot had made everyone forget, there would still be a record on file at S.H.I.E.L.D. The two await Elliott\'s arrival to confront him. When the jet lands, Charles asks Elliot to "come clean". Xavier confronts him with the truth that his parents are not dead and that Fury never took him to the mansion. When everyone begins attacking him, Elliot tries to make everyone all stop and forget why they are attacking him but this tactic fails to work completely thanks to Charles\' interference.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #73</ref>\n\nElliot decides he\'s through playing games and that he could have made the X-Men popular but now he has to kill everyone. However, Elliot is unaware of [[Jean Grey]]\'s presence much to Elliot\'s surprise.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #73</ref>\n\nA battle ensues, in which Magician once again summons the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy out of thin air. Magician binds the X-Men in metal and Jean fights the entire Brotherhood alone. Jean speaks psychically to [[Wolverine (Ultimate Marvel character)|Wolverine]] and obtains permission to burn away the metal binding him. Wolverine acquiesces and attacks Magician with little or no skin left. As the battle progresses, Wolverine slowly heals, slicing Magician\'s throat and finally jamming claws through him, apparently making Magician (and all traces of his work) disappear. A conversation between Magician and [[Kitty Pryde]] later revealed, however, that Magician simply wants to be left alone and wanted some closure to his story. It is revealed Kitty doesn\'t see or hear the Magician in any way. Magician states that he will now go somewhere that "there aren\'t any people, like [[Antarctica]] or something."<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #74</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Magician_%28Lee_Guardineer%29 Magician (Lee Guardineer)] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Magician_%28Ultimate%29 Magician of Earth-1610] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Lee_Guardineer_%28Earth-616%29 Magician (Lee Guardineer)] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Elliot_Boggs_%28Earth-1610%29 Magician of Earth-1610] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/the-magician/4005-36455/ Magician (Lee Guardineer)] at Comic Vine\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/magician/4005-42798/ Magician of Earth-1610] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Hank Pym}}\n{{Ultimate X-Men}}\n{{Ultimate Marvel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Magician (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Robert Kirkman]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2006]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from parallel universes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Marvel characters]]'
